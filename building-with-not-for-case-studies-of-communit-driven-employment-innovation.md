# Building with, not for: Case Studies of Community-Driven Employment Innovations


[Race and Technology: A Research Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7HFcN7LXRcAwq1N0-aazxTtdznLh87J)

*Speaker: Dr. Tawanna Dillahunt, Associate Professor at the University of Michiganâ€™s School of Information (UMSI)*

*Technology presents a force for positive change; however, technology has perpetuated racism and deepened social inequality and injustice seen in society. There are many reasons for these injustices within our design and development practices alone. Our underlying assumptions about who has access to technology inherently exclude the most negatively impacted. These voices are often missing from the design, development, and evaluation process. Their insight and genius are often missing from the technological narratives that we tell. However, it is unclear what approaches practitioners should take going forward and what steps they might take to integrate these approaches into their existing process. This presentation aims to unpack ways for practitioners to begin combatting the design, development, and deployment of technologies that reinforce and perpetuate racial inequality while designing*tools that align with the values and strengths of communities.

Speed-dating needs validation that generated prioritisation of already ideated ideas.
Participatory design sessions developed 'concepts'

Still describes a generate -> ideate -> develop solutions. These are informed and lead by the participants ideas but doesn't deeply describe the level to which the participants were involved (although earlier in the lecture there were descriptions of the limitations of the participants ability, access to knowledge and/or technology devices/tools and time or freedom to participate more than 'consultanted mode')

Innovation as understood as personal empowerment.
