# Talking-with-humanitarian-tech-group-about-OSS

### Introduction

On November the 4th 2021 I spoke with one of the two paid members of staf at [techfugees](https://techfugees.com/) they had reached out after seeing on of my talks that circulated in 2019-2020 around the project [Open Design - Eriol's forked repository](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/opendesign) (Archived repo from Ushahidi with issues [Open Design on Ushahidi](https://github.com/ushahidi/opendesign)). The specific talk was this one from [FOSS4G in 2019](https://youtu.be/KYOYSACLgdc) which is a conference specifically for geo/map based OSS projects to present and gather at. This talk was given before the active workshops in Taiwan and India that developed and tested the methodologies of the Open Design project and reported back on them to the funder, [Adobe Fund for Design](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/adobe-fund.html).

Techfugees wanted to ask 3 things of me, the first was for me to take a look at their recently re-developed principles for the organisation and the subseuqent local chapters (these local chapters are based around the world often closer in proximity to informal settlements and refugee camps) [The principles can be found here](https://www.notion.so/covidrefugees/Techfugees-Guiding-Principles-b869ab9cd6754c78bcd6e5391f020e4a) and specifcally the one related to [Open Source](https://www.notion.so/4-Sharing-is-caring-Opensource-e55de14465f5467bbc893b93e703dbdd). They also wanted to talk generally about short and long term committment on how to involve designers in the technology volunteering process around OSS contribution and they wanted to talk about how they, as an organisation looked to by vunerable people, curate and manage a list of OSS tools and software that are not 'owned' or 'maintained' by Techfugees but are submitted and platformed by Techfugees for refugees and how they can be certain of the sustainability and long term support of a particular OSS without a large maintenance task themselves.

We spoke about a number of these challenges across 3 key insights.


### Key Insights

1. The challenge with OSS in times of crisis, when technologists want to do something good in response to a crisis.

This is a replicatable and clear problem in the crisis and incident space in regards to technologists 'spinning up' Open Source Software (and other) projects that are 'helping' that particular crisis. This can clearly be seen when you observe what happened as COVID-19 became an increasingly global crisis where hackathons, project (both OSS and non OSS) became a regular occurence in the technology events communications (listed below). However, these technology events and projects rarely involved the people that the tools were intended to help in either a direct or inderct way. This was the same for functions outside of 'coding', a pattern in OSS outside of crisis but exacerbated by crisis where designers, researchers, product/community managers and documentarians are excluded often not explicitly, but implicitly by the culture and nature of OSS. We can observe a similar pattern emerge in the technology around the recent Afgan crisis with the UNDP's [Hack4Integrity](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=620497885038970) where as technologists are onboarded into a sphere of humanitarian and human rights as a avenue for thier skills growth and to feel as if they are contributing to crisis and problems globally the structures in place currently lack a view towards inclusion, contextual relevancy to the issue and sustainability of the OSS.

This was a criticism, which was directed at Techfugees by the UNHCR when they first started their work. Captured here in notes during an [interview with the UNHCR's innovation office](https://github.com/ushahidi/opendesign/issues/95) there were valid criticisms like that above, where Techfugues were mostly a group of non-refugees with little to no refugee field workers or organisational experts that 'made tech that wasn't needed' and that organisations like the UNHCR would gladly support initiatives that took into account the broad and complex challege of 'solving refugee problems'. Techfugees seems to be reconciling this history and moving forward along the same lines as the UNHCR who in the original interview were understandbly hesistent to engage with technologists efforts outside of the UN due in large part to the three identified missing components, inclusion, contextual relevancy and sustainability of the OSS.

As written in the Code vs COVID-19 article often the praised result is participation numbers and not the sustainability and relevancy of the tools, software and technology created as opposed to what I've stated above in terms of contexual relevancy, sustainability and inclusion this means that often these hackathons and events push short-term engagement (which the OSS worl is no stranger too) but in a sector (humanitarian and human rights) that cannot be approached in this way as the real world harms for when OSS fails vulnerable people are presented each time there is notable on-mass technologists flocking to a humanitarian or human rights challenge.

2. The challenge with how to help technologists interested in humanitarian technology to have better contextual background knowledge.

Many of the technologists interested in participating in humanitarian and human rights events and OSS projects 

A related but complicated personal challenge wrapped up in this topic is the challenge around concious or unconcious 'virtue signalling' of technologists. How can we begin to understand to what extent the value of the technology contributors is and how to direct resources in a sustainable way?



3. The challenge with how to help designers with access to methods for that contextual knowledge and the barriers into OSS as a designer.


Techfugees are interested now in what longer term enagagement in OSS looks liek from the volunteers, organisational team, global chapters and the refugee stakeholders themselves and are interested in what participating in this PhD research, focusing on designers involvement in OSS can do to draw attention to these challenges.
