# Talking-with-humanitarian-tech-group-about-OSS

### Introduction

On November the 4th 2021 I spoke with one of the two paid members of staf at [techfugees](https://techfugees.com/) they had reached out after seeing on of my talks that circulated in 2019-2020 around the project [Open Design - Eriol's forked repository](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/opendesign) (Archived repo from Ushahidi with issues [Open Design on Ushahidi](https://github.com/ushahidi/opendesign)). The specific talk was this one from [FOSS4G in 2019](https://youtu.be/KYOYSACLgdc) which is a conference specifically for geo/map based OSS projects to present and gather at. This talk was given before the active workshops in Taiwan and India that developed and tested the methodologies of the Open Design project and reported back on them to the funder, [Adobe Fund for Design](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/adobe-fund.html).

Techfugees wanted to ask 3 things of me, the first was for me to take a look at their recently re-developed principles for the organisation and the subseuqent local chapters (these local chapters are based around the world often closer in proximity to informal settlements and refugee camps) [The principles can be found here](https://www.notion.so/covidrefugees/Techfugees-Guiding-Principles-b869ab9cd6754c78bcd6e5391f020e4a) and specifcally the one related to [Open Source](https://www.notion.so/4-Sharing-is-caring-Opensource-e55de14465f5467bbc893b93e703dbdd).

### Key Insights

1. The challenge with OSS in times of crisis, when technologists want to do something good in response to a crisis.



2. The challenge with how to help technologists interested in humanitarian technology to have better contextual background knowledge.



3. The challenge with how to help designers with access to methods for that contextual knowledge and the barriers into OSS as a designer.
