 ### Thoughts
 
 This paper was...a difficult read and took a few twists an turns as well as number of comparitive tangents. I did however, 
 find some key ideas particularly interesting and worth pursuing.
 
 Notably a theme around comparing practices that have an 'output' that is 'unlike code' to those in FLOSS which typically 'have an output that is code' and what it means to translate and cross these cultures within the 'medium' or 'space' of FLOSS. Captured by this quote:_"How do we read a license not merely as a legal document but as a cultural document?"_
 
This paper raised some of the key elements of design/HCI culture aaround the subjects of 'romantic models' of artist retaining their works from a hostile market. This connects with an experience I have in practice which centred largely around design 'ego' and 'gatekeeping' as well as tying into topics around business practices around 'survival' 'value of design' as something that a 'client' pays for. This topic can quickly cascade into open design & open source design and the differences as well as the treatment of design as a function in a 'delivery focused' environment where the highest form of 'tangible' delivery is functional software code.

There was a connection to the tragedy of the commons in terms of 'ownership of creative thought and expression' and a skirting of the question of whether (or more like how) would creative endevours be 'commons'.

There's a quote about GPL license protecting the 'originating developers'. I would like to make sure that in my reserach i investigate in an appropriate manner how designers are considered within this culture (if at all) posing a question not unlike: If a designers is an 'orginating member' of an OSS tool then are they cosnidered protected? How do they consider their involvement?

At one (or more points) the term 'innovate' is used to describe the usage model of GPL license and I would like to understand what that means within a design/designer context especially when or if designers are employing any participatory practices when they create design work for FLOSS.

Read copyleft in detail.

The quote that starts "Well, the CD-ROM doesn’t tell you how I choreograph..." Can this also be applied to design and creativity? What about non-creative design practices like research led design? Is that 'not' creative?

Ethics of file sharing and design software.

Design participation as 'gift economy?"

 
 ### Questions
 
* What comparisons or correlations can be made between OSS and other creative disciplines? e.g. music, dance, film what difference (If any) does visual design pose?
* What can be learned about design involvemendt in co-creation remixing efforts vai Lawrence Lessig's writing?
* What are designers taught about 'licenses' in either educational spaces or in early career experiences?
* What does 'free' as in freedom mean to designers if anything?
* How do designers view unequal systems of globalistion?
* Do designers understand the idea of 'endless act of collaboration' within FLOSS? as there is seemingly no end to FLOSS 'improvements'
* Async distance collaboration and design - is this new? not new? understood? etc.
* What are the histories of collaboration within design? How do these relate to open content licenses?
* " but there is a danger that the authorial / artistic aura may make it more difficult for people to participate in a truly collaborative manner. " < Is this true?
* Media literacy of designers - learning how to write media by constructing lots of it and does this exist for designers in FLOSS? or only for coders in FLOSS?
* What reciprocity is expected by designers, in what forms and why? when they contribute to FLOSS?
* What do designers understand of communities and further, of fuzzy communities?
* What role did "piracy in the creation of a market" play with adobe and subsequent FLOSS alternatives and how do designers participate or understand this?
 
 
 ### Quotes
 
"We have seen a rapid emulation of the principles of free software in other
fields, especially in the realm of content and the process of cultural production
in the form of the creation of cultural artefacts such as music, literature and art. 
The idea of open source has now moved to the idea of open content,
where increasingly more and more people are familiarising themselves with a
new language that demands knowledge of ‘collaboration’, ‘sharing’ and other
such concepts."

"Even as copyright law and copyright enforcement increasingly become
more globalised (or, more accurately, Americanised), so do the alternatives to
copyright. There surely has to be a good reason why so many people from
different cultures are embracing the new language of open production and
collaboration."

"Theirs is a world that is more theatrical than ideological and oriented more to a play ethos, than to a work ethos. 
For them, access is already a way of life"

"what it may mean to translate the terms of the FLOSS model into other domains of cultural production such as the world of the arts, media etc., how do we begin to understand the idea of open code as a metaphor to other domains, is the idea of open code translatable across different configurations of knowledge, does it run into any serious difficulty when it encounters other forms of knowledge which may not have the same characteristics as code?"

"How do we read a license not merely as a legal document but as a cultural document"

"The romantic artist was therefore deemed to have property in an uncommodifiable imaginary self, so originality was elevated to being located in and belonging to the self of the author. Because the artist owns his original person or spirit, works created by such authors were also deemed to be original; and they could thus distinguish their personality from the expanding realm of mass produced goods."

"The dominant metaphor that is used in this regard is the tragedy of the commons, an argument that in the absence of private property as an incentive, there is no motivation to cultivate the commons"

"Licenses in fact are the invisible norms of cyberspace, if we go about our daily lives engaging and encountering legality on a day to day basis"

"In contrast, the majority of the GPL is designed to apportion rights to the users of the software covered by that license, with a secondary emphasis on protecting the **originating developers** of that software, in respect to the continuation of the availability of the software source-codes (under theGPL) in perpetuity."

"the license as a model of regulating knowledge circulation is becoming a norm which pervades not merely a set of products such as media commodities, but when even older forms start taking on the characteristics of a license"

"1. Users should be allowed to run the software for any purpose. 2. Users should be able to closely examine and study the software and should be able to freely modify and improve it to fill their needs better. 3. Users should be able to give copies of the software to other people to whom the software will be useful. 4. Users should be able to improve the software and freely distribute their improvements to the broader public so that they, as a whole, benefit."

"Signaling the crisis that copyright law seems to be faced, she suggests that it is perhaps time for us to reexamine some of the fundamental doctrines in light of the developments in modes of production and cultural creation. The crisis is not merely a political economy question of the control of media, in the increasingly unequal world of globalization."

"She is referring specifically to the free art license that was initiated by artists themselves, and which posits itself as a license with a copyleft attitude. “Protests from artists take not only verbal or “oratorical” form, but also draw upon alternative methods of legal protection. Thus, the Free Art License developed in France by artists and theoreticians encourages authors to protect their work using a model that includes exchange, freedom of reproduction, and even appropriation. The name given to this new paradigm of creation is copyleft."

"Barthes...The text also abolishes the sharp divide between the binary of the author/reader, and starts becoming something that is actually shared by the author and the reader. The distance between writing and reading is abolished, and tied into one and the same signifying practice."

"Nothing could be further from the truth, and in reality the history of creativity and cultural production has always been a history of collaboration, of using existing works and building on them. This memory of creativity and production is one that has been dulled by the elaborate story of copyright and its modernist Baudelairean fantasy of stunning originality that was inspired by genius. What the FLOSS movement and the GNU GPL enable us to do is refresh our memory of cultural production as an endless act of collaboration, and it also enables us a new language, that of the license through which this approach to production can rearticulate itself."

"cultural production is that it can very easily become a distribution issue alone, but it would tragic if the FLOSS model were seen only as a distribution issue, which is the ability for people to allow their works to be accessed, rather than have any limitations placed on access. As we have seen in the previous section, the challenge f the FLOSS model really emerges form the fact that it genuinely creates a scenario where the user producer model becomes the norm, and which allows for the rearticulation of the idea of work as a collaborative process."

"a certain disembodied quality to labour in software (the condition that for instance allows for the emergence of new divisions of labour and the ‘offshore software development’ model). Of course the disembodied ness also allows then for an ease with which collaborative efforts can take place even in the comfort of relative autonomy. In fact it could even be possible to argue that sometimes the collaboration is possible, precisely because of the relative personal distance between collaborators on a project. • The nature of software is also very tied to the question of its ‘functional’ aspect, where the form of knowledge and the functionality is very closely tied into each other."

"This is not to say that question of aesthetics do not play a role in software, they certainly play an important role but the beauty of code may be judged by a different set of aesthetics considerations than say is normally the case when we think of cultural production."

"Scott then goes on to describe the collective process of the creation of open source software and states that “It would be difficult to apply this concept of collective creativity as it might relate to choreography..."
"Seen in this light, it is possible to suggest that there is some aspect of Open Source software in operation in the practice of sharing choreographic methods”

"Well, the CD-ROM doesn’t tell you how I choreograph, it doesn’t teach you anything other than how to observe motion. (…) It shows just some of the ways of thinking about analyzing motion. I think there is a whole new attitude towards work. Put it this way: work is not some sort of secret. It’s rather superstitious to think one has to keep one’s method secret. (…) At the end of the 20th century, work doesn’t need to be kept secret. It won’t disappear just because we communicate. We might be apprehended, so to speak, and that could force us to abandon our own methods, which is not such a bad thing either. (…) I would hope that the users would actually discover their own dancing en route to understanding ours."

"But the critical component that does not get captured is that within the ethic of the choreography, the freedom to perform some person’s piece or even incorporate someone’s piece may only be a small portion of the story of collaboration."

"But there is a danger that the authorial / artistic aura may make it more difficult for people to participate in a truly collaborative manner."

"In most parts of the world, the end user of the operating system is still finally an end user who has no great desire to tweak around with the code, and the freedoms that are spoken of in the GNU GPL really then addresses a small, albeit important segment of users who are also coders. In many ways the user producer model is rendered more democratic when you look at the desktop applications level, not as someone who necessarily wants to tweak the code behind an application, but as someone who learns how to operate various programs, tinkers with them and uses them to tweak content, which may be completely proprietary in nature."

"The giving and taking of a gift sets in chain a complex relationship of reciprocity, where a gift transaction is always incomplete until the person receiving the gift has also given the gift back.While the relationship of reciprocity may be between the gift giver and the gift taker, it is certainly not restricted only to them and the exchange of the gift actually brings into play an economy of circulation, which includes a wider network of participation by members of the community."

"“I gave him a gift but he did not show any reciprocity”. The modern law of contract does not require any reciprocity for a transaction which does not have the intention to become a contract, and yet in the world of gift giving and gift taking, ingratitude is a very important marker of whether the duties or reciprocities brought about by the gift have been fulfilled."

"what exactly is the nature of this community and what is the nature of the contract that binds them. ...is also at the same time a symbolic commitment to a larger community. The whole point if a general public license that is that it is targeted at a larger community and not aimed only at the monadic individual as in the case for instance of an ‘end user’ license agreement. What exactly then is the nature of this commitment."

"the idea of a fuzzy community to an enumerated one. A fuzzy community is always an imprecise community, and lacks the coherence provided the moment you become an a part of an enumerated community (that is you are counted as being ‘a citizen of India’ for instance). This movement from a fuzzy to an enumerated community in the case of nationalism is accomplished by the category of the citizen subject, an omnibus category that worked primarily as a transactional site and a mechanism for all other actions that are we collectively call democracy, in short as precisely the beginning of a narration."

"Participating in a movement includes or involves something like accepting contractual obligations and I suspect some of the affiliation of the individual to movements counteracting a monadic individualism is accomplished by narrative contracts”."

"a relationship of some obligation, but it also brings the individual into a network or an imagined community of some form, with which the individual can counteract monadic individualism. While for the purposes of national histories, the site where this narrative contract takes place is the constitution/ nation, how is this useful in our understanding and reading of open content licenses?"

"where increasingly almost every cultural resource is the subject of protection. There is an argument that there is therefore a shrinkage of the public domain"

"This period of tremendous growth is however marked clearly by its troubled relationship with legality, with various practices that often straddled both the worlds of legality and illegality sometimes making it difficult to distinguish one from the other."
