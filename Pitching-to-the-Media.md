## March 10 Workshop on: Pitching to the media

Please bring a 300 word draft of an email pitching your research to an editor or producer. Your draft should identify which platform you are pitching to, why your idea will be of interest to them, and what you are offering (if an essay, word length and delivery date; if a radio documentary, how many episodes and delivery date, etc).
During the session we will then work through your pitch, offering guidance and advice to come up with a revised version during a group workshop.

### Pitch Sample

Hi there [media outlet]

Designers have been developing their portfolios and increasing their expertise through ‘speculative’ or ‘imaginary’ personal projects for X years and has become a reasonably established way of growing your skills outside of an internship or paid freelance projects I’m here to present a growing alternative to these imaginary projects which leans on my research into why and how designers can get involved in and benefit from developing their expertise and contributing design to open source software project like X, Y and Z.

The key points to this piece are:
* Framing OSS in terms that are familiar to designers
* What has been tried and tester in this space including big names like X, Y and Z
* What the benefits are to this approach for designers of all career levels
* And finally wrapping up with how this improves the design community/industry as a whole.

The piece would leave readers/listeners with the state of the community as it is now and the future where a shift in design culture means meaningful involvement in core, collaborative and global technology tools and communities further embeds design as a critical part of how we calibrate and build useable, user focussed technology that benefits designers heart, head and career development.
