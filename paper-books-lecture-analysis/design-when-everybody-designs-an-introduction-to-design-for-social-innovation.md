# Design, when everybody designs: An introduction to Design for social innovation

The writing starts out with an application to participate in a study and then moves on to discuss *'The Socio-Technical Gap (Ackerman, 2000) is a term used in tech design and development which refers to a chasm that exists between the “socio-” and the “ –technical.”'*

The writer then goes on to reference a video presentation from Yifan Lin and Dr. Robin E. Mays where they discuss the ethics of the humanitarian space and how it is, broadly speaking, governed by principles of 'do no harm' ethics and how you act and how it benefits a humanitarian purpose or principle. Whereas software development/technology is 'a-moral' in the sense that if something in technology tools harms a human and breaches their human rights or fails to meet the humanitarian principles it is 'no ones specific fault'. Technology therefore sits outside of a culture, socially monitored space.

They speak to the two contrasting perspectives by describing Ethical responsibility as tied to personal behaviour in STEM (technology) spaces. Ethics are autonomous and can be decided on a case
