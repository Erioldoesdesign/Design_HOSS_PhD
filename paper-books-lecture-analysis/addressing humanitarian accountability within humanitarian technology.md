# Addressing Humanitarian Accountability Within Humanitarian Tech 

The writing starts out with an application to participate in a study and then moves on to discuss *'The Socio-Technical Gap (Ackerman, 2000) is a term used in tech design and development which refers to a chasm that exists between the “socio-” and the “ –technical.”'*

The writer then goes on to reference a video presentation from Yifan Lin and Dr. Robin E. Mays where they discuss the ethics of the humanitarian space and how it is, broadly speaking, governed by principles of 'do no harm' ethics and how you act and how it benefits a humanitarian purpose or principle. Whereas software development/technology is 'a-moral' in the sense that if something in technology tools harms a human and breaches their human rights or fails to meet the humanitarian principles it is 'no ones specific fault'. Technology therefore sits outside of a culture, socially monitored space.

They speak to the two contrasting perspectives by describing Ethical responsibility as tied to personal behaviour in STEM (technology) spaces. Ethics are autonomous and can be decided on a case by case basis.

In the main text of the page there is then some elaboration in relation to how humanitarian technology is even harder to parse. 

*"First, tech creators don’t actually know what they need to support humanitarians socially.  There is a lack of adequate understanding of the ways humanitarians are effectively translating humanitarian accountability into the details of their work with communities on the ground."*

*"Second, technically speaking, current technology design and development methods are not meant to accommodate what is needed to create ICTs that can be accountable to our humanitarian values."*

The balance being between what is is the Humanitarian 'actor' (organisation, institution or combination of these) wants/hopes to achieve and what is technologically feasible within the given circumstances.
This comment speaks to a difficult space where technology creators do not have access to the Humanitarian situation and given 'proxy' information or they are weakly inducted into a sanitised Humanitarian situation. 
Rarely, if ever are discussions about what creating Humanitarian technology within the affected populations are had or empowered. 
Even here the mention of co-creation in a section on how to 'close the gap' between technologists and Humanitarian's describes the Humanitarian institution working with the technologists and discussing/meeting *"ethical" socio-requirements, and establish a formal assessment"* in order to ascertain accountability. This misses a community, co-creative approach that has a sense of realism about the political and social structures or attemps to remove the political and social realities of the affected populations and 'take responsibility' of those via the Humanitarian actor.

The two research questions from this project are:

How are humanitarian ethical imperatives addressed in the development, design, implementation, and use of HICT?
How can an understanding of these HICT interactions be translated into frameworks for successfully achieving more ethically-centered STEM cultures?


A connected paper abstract states:

*Designing information systems (IS) in support of humanitarian work has been a challenge widely pursued for decades. However, one aspect that has been undervalued within systems design is the role of the underpinning humanitarian values and culture as part of system effectiveness. Further, it remains understudied how we might incorporate those values into the information system design process. We address both these aspects by 1) analyzing humanitarian values of effectiveness as they impact information systems design, and 2) incorporating humanitarian values as part of the design criteria. In this paper, we present the idea that the “maturity” of an IS design to be effective for the humanitarian context is assessed by how well it incorporates humanitarian values. Therefore, we move away from a product-centered design towards an approach, which features the socio-technical relationship. We present a maturity matrix, which aims to translate and communicate humanitarian effectiveness into the design and development terminology used by technology designers. This matrix is housed within a participatory framework that allows for the development of trust and shared understanding between these two domains. The framework serves as a road-map for designers and humanitarian agencies to adapt the IS design and development process to better accommodate the IS needs of the humanitarian mission, its values, and culture.*
