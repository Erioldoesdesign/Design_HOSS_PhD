This was not a paper but background reading on the general tragedy of the commons.

I think the key aspects to think of in terms of my research into designs and H-OSS is around the key issues of: Sharing in the commons, Ownership, Ego, Dominance, The concept of governance in design (or the absence of it).

Designers may benefit from insight into tragedy of the commons and why/how it can affect OSS orgs and potentially social good/H-OSS more than non-H-OSS but it may not be a key entry point into this research.
