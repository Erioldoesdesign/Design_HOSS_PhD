# Original Research questions #1
1. What gaps can be identified in the ways that HOSS projects currently interact and communicate with designers and users that differ in their interaction and communication with engineers?  Gap analysis of HOSS, designer/s and user interactions and communications.

2. From these gaps, how can we inform designers, HOSS and users with complementary knowledge of each other in order to better collaborate? Testable information exchange structure between HOSS, Designer/s and users with M&E of the impact of the testable structure.

3. What mechanisms could support greater collaboration between stakeholders (HOSS, designers, users) to support HOSS to achieve results for communities in need of humanitarian assistance? Facilitated collaborative workshops.

4. Can we measure the impact of human-centred design on HOSS from these collaboration mechanisms? Statistical analysis of the impact HCD contributions have had on the HOSS, focusing on meeting user needs.

5. What does a peer-support, global, collaborative design community need in order to support itself when collaborating with and on HOSS? Qualitative data from stakeholders that informs recommendations for community structures that indenture healthy HCD contribution to HOSS.

# Original Research questions #2

1. How do activists, vulnerable communities and humanitarian organisations currently describe and practice their engagements with HOSS and the value of design on issues of ‘dying’ language survival, data security and protection from human rights abuses

2. How do activists, communities and designers envision, describe and articulate future collaborative approaches for HOSS?

3. What human rights centred design mechanisms and resources could support collaborative HOSS for communities of practice engaged in data-based activism and social justice?
