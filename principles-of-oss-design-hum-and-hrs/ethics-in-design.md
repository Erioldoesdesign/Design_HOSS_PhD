You can really see that the most-specialised magazine becomes the more elitist or excluding other public. And designers think that their work is relevant to [a] wider audience. Designers believe that their work can change the world, they believe that their work applies to all level of society and different walks of life but in practice, discussions in design remain very isolated." - Re creating a publication that was about design but not for designers - Pete Bil'ak 9.00 mins
