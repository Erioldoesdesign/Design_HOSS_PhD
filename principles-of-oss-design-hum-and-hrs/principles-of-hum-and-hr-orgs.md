# Principles from Humanitarian and Human Rights organisations and movements

### [Innovation by design at UNICEF: An Ethnographic case study](https://www.academia.edu/16972372/Innovation_by_Design_at_UNICEF) 
re. the definitions and practices of 'Innovation' mostly in repsonse to technology at UNICEF but inclusive of some aspects of design.

### [The White house - Quad Principles on Technology Design, Development, Governance, and Use](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/24/quad-principles-on-technology-design-development-governance-and-use/)
Civic technology/Public goods are, arguably also orgs that work for 'citizens' - hard to classify as humanitarian and human rights focussed but hopefully humanitarian and human rights respecting. Linked more with SDGS likely. Also have a strong committment to OSS.

* We are committed to fostering an open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystem, based on mutual trust and confidence, and we welcome all nations to support the following principles*
* tangible benefits for society, developed through a multi-stakeholder approach that is adaptive, dynamic, and aligns with universal values, including respect for freedom of expression and privacy.
* autonomy, agency, and dignity of individuals.  
* design, development, governance, and use of technology should be an equitable and inclusive process
* Technology should not be misused or abused for malicious activities such as authoritarian surveillance and oppression, for terrorist purposes, or to disseminate disinformation.
* built upon trust, integrity, and resilience foster innovation.
* openness and interoperability to enable collaboration and to welcome innovators who are both diverse in their gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as in the size, structure, and age of their organizations.
* produce and maintain secure systems, and to be trustworthy, transparent, and accountable in their practices. Technology developers should also build in safety and security-by-design 
* Resilient, diverse, and secure technology supply chains
* fair and open marketplace is a cornerstone of innovation and inclusive prosperity.
* free and fair market competition
* encourage the development of competitive technology ecosystems
* importance of industry-led, consensus-based multi-stakeholder approaches to international standards development that foster interoperability, compatibility, and inclusiveness.
* reducing barriers to data and knowledge sharing for research projects and greater innovation
* facilitating the exchange of researchers
* developing shared research and development agendas
* keep pace with changes in the global economy and innovation processes by monitoring future trends
* fostering technology development that accelerates economic progress 


### [Techfugees Guiding Principles](https://www.notion.so/Techfugees-Guiding-Principles-b869ab9cd6754c78bcd6e5391f020e4a)
Possibly out of date by now these were writtena nd shared when I (Eriol) initially reached out to techfugess to work with them as a potential case study. 
Three main priciples are:
1. We accelerate **Innovation** through collaborative implementation and technical support of digital products and services providing access to education, information, healthcare, employment and fostering participation in society of marginalized communities.
2. We research to collect **Insights** and create open data platforms that supports the ethics behind our guiding principles whilst elevating those unheard displaced voices to the forefront to amplify their experience.
3. We orchestrate **Inclusion** programs to provide digital upskilling and access to work opportunities for the tech sector to tap undiscovered digital talent amongst displaced people to foster socio-economic growth  in their new communities.

They then have some specific Hackathon/event related principles covered in my [writing related to my hackathons observation work](#)
