# Personal autoethnography on designing for a social good focussed OSS organisation over the period of a year.

### Definition of autoethnography / personal autoethnography

_'As a method, autoethnography combines characteristics of autobiography and ethnography. When writing an autobiography, an author retroactively and selectively writes about past experiences. Usually, the author does not live through these experiences solely to make them part of a published document; rather, these experiences are assembled using hindsight (Bruner, 1993; Denzin, 1989; Freeman, 2004). In writing, the author also may interview others as well as consult with texts like photographs, journals, and recordings to help with recall (Delany, 2004; Didion, 2005; Goodall, 2006; Hermann, 2005).'_


## Abstract

This paper presents an autoenthography of my experiences as an employed designer at an OSS and 'social good' focussed organisation over the period of 1 year.
These writings are recollections and some references to written material but as I did not keep a diary as I was working the statements could be affected by memory recall. They are also my own perspective of interactions that often had 1 or many in them with different histories and priorities within the projects and as their job function.

However, few designers working and contributing to OSS write and recall their experiences within these organisations. Therefore I mean for this to both be a record of experiences and useful capture of how design operates within OSS for social good environments.
I particularly want to draw attention to the efforts and experiences of the designer (the author) in the OSS for social good as this is a less documented and understood function within OSS.

## Introduction
In the summer of 2020 I joined my 3rd OSS organisation as an 'on staff' designer. My previous two workplaces were an international NGO working on Humanitarian OSS and an agency that worked specifically with CiviCRM for charity and third sector clients. This 3rd OSS organisation was the first I joined since becoming much more deeply embedded within the OSS global community through conferences, talks and communities like opensourcedesign.net and by this point, I was growing my proficiency in understanding OSS culture and processes and how they differed from other organisational environments. As such I'd been thinking much more about the role of design and designers in OSS more broadly and how sustainability could be grown and acheived from a design perspective within a particular OSS organisation. I talked about this curiosity and want to explore growing design sustainability with this 3rd organisation early in our conversations along with more of my thoughts and experiences on how design can be done 'successfully' in OSS cultures and how design works alongside the other functions, both paid and unpaid within OSS.

I've spilt this paper into key sections and conversations around particular interactions or topics. For example the relationship between a 'product management' function and design across the lifecycle of my time in this project is seperated out into it's own section given the volume and importance of interactions. 

### Related work

Much of this experience relates to my PhD generally and also the work around ['Open Design'](https://github.com/ushahidi/opendesign) which was started in the first Humanitarian OSS organisation I worked in through a grant fund from [Adobe's fund for design](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/adobe-fund.html).
Some of this also relates to the work I do as a maintainer/custodian of [opensourcedesign.net](https://opensourcedesign.net/). In terms that the community is generally interested and supportive of design and designers roles in OSS.

### History of the OSS project
In general terms the history of this OSS project is they've been operational for 10+ years, volunteer founded by some code-experienced people, built upoin previous OSS technology with a specific purpose and supported through various funding means including user fees, grant funding and consultancy commision work.
There was a large amount of technical debt (over 400+ issues in the backlog) and a large migration project in progress from the old OSS platform that the product was built on originally. Many of the user interface features were 'old fashioned' and difficult for users to figure out intuitively. The users of the tool relied heavily on those that were familiar with the tool from many years of working on the code or setting up for others, the customer support team and documentation user guides. Some work had been done by previous design contractors on improving things like the responsive mobile experience and generally the ux of the tool. 

These design efforts could be described by the ['design by committee'](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-avoid-design-by-committee-and-why-you-should-at-all-costs-8e8ce78c1058) many of the members of the project had a core belief that they knew what was best for the tool because ['they were users themselves'](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/false-consensus/). On observing previous design projects many were slowed by intensive processes of feedback on incidental details and not a focus on iterative testing with real users (or simulated real users outside of the project) and a difficulty moving away from a mentality that we, the 'owners' or 'maintainers' of the OSS know whats best for our users. Design was beginning to get users involved but there was a hesitency and nervousness with involving users due to 'brand impression' and influenced by previous bad experiences with a design process where improvements were 'promised' and not delivered within the timeline the users who were engaged with expected. 


### Hiring and Interview process

The organisation I'm focussing on during this autoethnography was one that had put out a job advert for the position they were hiring for. Some of the key criteria were:
_- To set up the Design practice including seamless onboarding of new designers, and creating a plan for all the tools and assets needed for an efficient ux/design practice (style guide etc)
- Ownership of platform wide UX optimisation, strategic UX vision and roadmap
- Hands on production of project based UX assets translating requirements into the optimal user experience to brief developers
- Ownership of data driven user requirements
- User testing and user research ownership and analysis_

_Senior Product Designer who loves to work end-to-end. You’ll be helping to set product strategy with your deep knowledge of our users, right through to pairing with engineers to release your work in to the wild. When we say end to end, we really mean it. If you’re someone who has years of research theory but haven’t seen through to shipping the product then perhaps this isn’t the place for you._

I added this snippet from the initial job description posting to give a sense of what the organisation stated that they wanted from the beginning of the hiring process. Job description rarely encompass the entorety of a role and that often eveolves over time and can flex with the different skills that a hire may bring to a role. Outside of the job description I brought an interest in developing a sustainable open source design strategy to the OSS project.
This was the first 'on staff' designer this org had hired for and they looked to an existing product manager with experience in an additional role to the OSS org to define what was needed from a design hire within the OSS org. They had in the previous 6 months brought on a first time volunteer design contributor to start a large scale back-end redesign process that had some deep user complexity.
At the same time as a permanent design lead role another support role was hired for of 'product manager'. Existing product managers on the project appeared to have come from a technical project management, coding or domain specific background and many had not done product management in OSS before this project.

Early on in the hiring process the importance was empahsised that advocacy, education and strategy would be a key part of the role in brining the OSS organisation into 'modernity' with non-OSS competitors in terms of how design was built into a process. However, little was spoken about in terms of what design efforts or influence had been done before.

### Understanding the OSS and other tooling

Understanding the OSS is one of the first tasks anyone should engage in when they join an OSS project. Understanding the historical context of the project helps to untangle any biases, thought structures or hierarchy that exists within the project in order to effectively begin to design well.


### Design strategical embedding and the value of 'delivery'

Something that became increasingly evident in the structure of this OSS project is how design was valued and understood within the exitisting contexts of the OSS and the valued functions within the OSS organisation. This presented most obviously as a focus on 'tangible deliverables' in such that design that was 'visible and a commonly accepted understanding of design' was the most understood and therefore valued. In simpler terms the type of design that was clearly valued was visual design and User Interface design. Any design efforts that were more 'ambigious' were difficult to understand in terms of 'how to operationalise a solution' e.g. results of user testing of a particular feature or part of the experience and the designers extrapolation of the user centred insights therein. Unless these were clearly expressed as UI interventions and presented as such they were not 'valued' as highley as something immediately understandable and executable. This was also true of any verbal or written design recommnedations in issues or in communications channels.

There was a focus on channeling the organisational and developer focused interpretations of 'what was best' in such that often user feedback from testing sessions and user interviews were responded to as 'That's what users always say' or 'We've heard this before and we know this' further compounding the difficulty the project had when presented with 'user expressed' needs that were not obvious 'solutions' that were agreed with by the team e.g. 'We need this function over in this section of the software and we could express this in the UI by a button that does the same function but now here'. Whereas the users would offer feedback like 'I want to be able to do X process quicker or with less confusion and currenty I do this by doing X, Y and Z processes'.
When users express a 'solution' e.g. 'I want a button here that does X' the role of a design is to truly understand hat problem or task that user is trying to solve that they believe having a button 'there' will solve. The logic being that there may be a better way of solving that problem through design that we have yet to discover.

There was also a tension around time and resourcing of design that relates to the concept of 'value'. Any design that was best understood by the organisation (e.g. UI design, Visual design) was a given as 'good use of time'. Parts of design that were less well understood and why were viewed with some measure of confusion as to the value of organisational resources (paid time). The time that was needed to help the organisation understand the value of non-visual, non-UI design was therefore also viewed as 'non-optional' use of time and resources. This was often expressed through the need for 'solutions' rather than a 'process to a solution' and queries about 'why so much time needed to be spent understanding what we were solving and how' rather than presenting solutions for feedback and opinion-based approval. The effort from design here being the emphasis on a co-created, co-collaborative, open-focussed design process where as many stakeholders are involved and onboarded into the process of understanding. 


### Discussing processes that include 'good' design practices

In the past this OSS project has worked with a handful of independant design contractors and volunteers. Due to the nature of the engagement and the background of these designers the relationship between the OSS project and it's core team members that engaged with the design processes meant that they were considered as 'the stakeholder' of the OSS and not 'A stakeholder' of the OSS. The complexity of 'who are the users and at what capacity?' within OSS projects is a difficult one and varies from OSS project/community to OSS project/community. 
These past experiences with designers that were unfamiliar with a community or OSS approach to building software coupled with the OSS core teams assumptions about design processes from the general information that is present in society lead to a process that was very 'design as a delivery output' specifically for "the few" most engagaged, profiecient and available core OSS team members. They presented what they wanted based on their own (or some limited customer insight via a customer support team), designers were unable to do research to validate these needs and build hypothesis questions to investigate witha. wider user base and therefore 'created mock-ups and designs' for these small groups of users (see scratch you own itch developer processes in OSS) and these were commented on, adapted and pushed into the shape that these few core team members wanted. Sometimes however, the core team would ask the designer for their input which was often a 'best guess' design input based on prior knowledge as the designers were unable to do research to gather evidence to know for sure what they thought would work for users, would indeed work.

This lack of experience with a user hypothesis and user research led design approach transformed over time into an avoidance of user insight gather by design research and I got the distinct impression it was a worry that the wider user base would want different features and software than the core team. This was later validate in a small piece of user research I was able to do with a more wider user base that did not have as deep investment and involvement in the OSS as the 'core team' did. This research raised points that the core team knew about, but that they had already formulated their own 'solutions' to that they were reasonably convinced would solve the problem for both themsleves and all other users. Product discussions were punctuated with statements such as 'If we just built X then this would solve everyones problems' etc. it was hard to, as a designer helping the OSS team grow their design understanding and maturity, steer them away from solutions focus to an ideation to validation to build and test process.

### Our processes and embedding them

### Design's value in in OSS as a delivery output

### Cross team collaboration challenges: Developer team


### Cross team collaboration challenges: Product team



### Cross team collaboration challenges: Customer Support

Working with the  customer support team had both positives and negatives. The positives were generaly the the customer support team did have this deeper insight into how users used and spoke about our OSS tool. However a complication arised when customer support was asked and sometimes pexpected to do the work of user research without support and training. Interview skills for design research are able to be learned but not without supporta nd guidance and often the CS team was performing user research without specifically the improvisation skills needed for contextual inquiry via design research interviews. The CS team had an interest in how design and user research could collaborate but again as seen with the dev team the constraints on cross team collaborationa nd what 'was and wasn't part of a paid role' was difficult to break out of. There was a tension around why CS is doing design work and why design wants to do work that to some, looks like customer facing work. This was hard to convince and express the value of. A similar tension rose within any community engagement tasks and involvement as the wider 'delivery team' saw time spent with the community as time 'not producing outputs'. I expressed many times that time spent with users, community and wider team members produced inisght on what would later become better informed 'outputs' but a strange expectation of 'the designer' surfaced in an expectation that 'the designer should know how to design a good tool or feature' and there was frustration and puzzled attitudes as to why designer spending time 'gathering insight' was valuable. I often expressed this as 'I cannot design affectively for something I do not understand the motivatios of and do not have the context of and that, is what is required of the wider team in terms of 'investment' in design practices and a 'user centred software tool'.

### Cross team collaboration challenges: Community/Users
Parts of the community however were very receptive to design processes and inclusion and many OSS instance teams and members saw the chance to had design present at thei meetings as a way of 'being heard' by the core OSS team. This to me was building a valuable foundation for respect and inclusion beyond the 'most engaged' users and allowed for more ethnographic gathering of insights regarding our user base. Recording these insights became difficult to maintain.


### Cross team collaboration challenges: Designer contributors

Working with a wider OSS design volunteer contributor team became a way in which I as lead designer on the team, introduced a method of critique and checks and baances around the design work that I was producing and building. No single designer in isolation will have an easy time of making design work that meets user needs and all designers (mostly) rwquire a team around them to keep them supported and reflective on their design work. This also helps with wider inclusion work within the design for OSS. The OSS design contributor team fluctuated between 5 to 15 members working on various design tasks managed by myself and mostly self-directed as projects. None of these projects have yet to feed into the priority delivery tasks for this OSS tool.
Team building independant of the wider organisation...


The last note on 'good design processes' and the difficult embedding them has to regard the issue of scale and resources in relation to designs role responsibilities.
