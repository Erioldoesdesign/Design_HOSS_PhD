# Personal autoethnography on designing for a social good focussed OSS organisation over the period of a year.

### Definition of autoethnography / personal autoethnography

_'As a method, autoethnography combines characteristics of autobiography and ethnography. When writing an autobiography, an author retroactively and selectively writes about past experiences. Usually, the author does not live through these experiences solely to make them part of a published document; rather, these experiences are assembled using hindsight (Bruner, 1993; Denzin, 1989; Freeman, 2004). In writing, the author also may interview others as well as consult with texts like photographs, journals, and recordings to help with recall (Delany, 2004; Didion, 2005; Goodall, 2006; Hermann, 2005).'_


## Abstract

This paper presents an autoenthography of my experiences as an employed designer at an OSS and 'social good' focussed organisation over the period of 1 year.
These writings are recollections and some references to written material but as I did not keep a diary as I was working the statements could be affected by memory recall. They are also my own perspective of interactions that often had 1 or many in them with different histories and priorities within the projects and as their job function.

However, few designers working and contributing to OSS write and recall their experiences within these organisations. Therefore I mean for this to both be a record of experiences and useful capture of how design operates within OSS for social good environments.
I particularly want to draw attention to the efforts and experiences of the designer (the author) in the OSS for social good as this is a less documented and understood function within OSS.

## Introduction
In the summer of 2020 I joined my 3rd OSS organisation as an 'on staff' designer. My previous two workplaces were an international NGO working on Humanitarian OSS and an agency that worked specifically with CiviCRM for charity and third sector clients. This 3rd OSS organisation was the first I joined since becoming much more deeply embedded within the OSS global community through conferences, talks and communities like opensourcedesign.net and by this point, I was growing my proficiency in understanding OSS culture and processes and how they differed from other organisational environments. As such I'd been thinking much more about the role of design and designers in OSS more broadly and how sustainability could be grown and acheived from a design perspective within a particular OSS organisation. I talked about this curiosity and want to explore growing design sustainability with this 3rd organisation early in our conversations along with more of my thoughts and experiences on how design can be done 'successfully' in OSS cultures and how design works alongside the other functions, both paid and unpaid within OSS.

I've spilt this paper into key sections and conversations around particular interactions or topics. For example the relationship between a 'product management' function and design across the lifecycle of my time in this project is seperated out into it's own section given the volume and importance of interactions. 

### Related work

Much of this experience relates to my PhD generally and also the work around ['Open Design'](https://github.com/ushahidi/opendesign) which was started in the first Humanitarian OSS organisation I worked in through a grant fund from [Adobe's fund for design](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/adobe-fund.html).
Some of this also relates to the work I do as a maintainer/custodian of [opensourcedesign.net](https://opensourcedesign.net/). In terms that the community is generally interested and supportive of design and designers roles in OSS.


### Hiring and Interview process

The organisation I'm focussing on during this autoethnography was one that had put out a job advert for the position they were hiring for. Some of the key criteria were

### Understanding the OSS and other tooling

### Advocacy across functions and organisational team build

### OFN Design strategical embedding 

### Open Source Design Team building independant of the wider organisation

### Cross team collaboration challenges: Developer team

### Cross team collaboration challenges: Product team

### Cross team collaboration challenges: Community/Users

### Discussing processes that include 'good' design practices
