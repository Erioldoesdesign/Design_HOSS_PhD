# Autoethnographic diaries of Design in HOSS

Both my paid part-time work role and my volunteer role within multiple OSS communities often require and/or encourage me to be present at various events to do with OSS. More rarely am I present at events that are primarily to do with humanitarian/human rights (Hum/HR's) work and even more rarely am I at events centred around design (in any way of describing design). As such, I pay attention to the conversations, talks, panels and statements made at OSS events about design, especially when it pertained to a percieved or actual social good.

This autoethnogrpahic aspect to my PhD research will focus on:

- A relational interpretation of what is discussed and asked directly to me or as part of conversations with other regarding design in OSS, design in Humanitarian/Human Rights work and the intersection of these three.
- Notes on talks listened to that relate to one of the three topics (Design, OSS and Hum/HR's).
- Informal interviews with people that have experiences with the intersection of these three topics (Design, OSS and Hum/HR's) around specific set questions related to my research as it develops.
- A qualatative and quantative diary of my experiences and reflections on these events in relation to the three topics (Design, OSS and Hum/HR's).
- A list of potential interviewees for further structured aspects of the PhD research.
- Investigating potential case study projects and people.
