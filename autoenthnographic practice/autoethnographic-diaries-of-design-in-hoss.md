# Autoethnographic diaries of Design in HOSS

Both my paid part-time work role and my volunteer role within multiple OSS communities often require and/or encourage me to be present at various events to do with OSS. More rarely am I present at events that are primarily to do with humanitarian/human rights (Hum/HR's) work and even more rarely am I at events centred around design (in any way of describing design). As such, I pay attention to the conversations, talks, panels and statements made at OSS events about design, especially when it pertained to a percieved or actual social good.

This autoethnogrpahic aspect to my PhD research will focus on:

- A relational interpretation of what is discussed and asked directly to me or as part of conversations with other regarding design in OSS, design in Humanitarian/Human Rights work and the intersection of these three.
- Notes on talks listened to that relate to one of the three topics (Design, OSS and Hum/HR's).
- Informal interviews with people that have experiences with the intersection of these three topics (Design, OSS and Hum/HR's) around specific set questions related to my research as it develops.
- A qualatative and quantative diary of my experiences and reflections on these events in relation to the three topics (Design, OSS and Hum/HR's).
- A list of potential interviewees for further structured aspects of the PhD research.
- Investigating potential case study projects and people.

## FOSDEM 2024

**Context of attendance at event and affiliations**
My attendance at FOSDEM was connected to and affiliated with two organisational entities I have been invovled in for 6+ years and 3+ years respectively.
The first is a community group focussed on designers that contribute to open source software. opensourcedesign.net has existed for around 8-10 years and at least 2 of the founders are still reasonably active in the maintainer communication channels. 
The other spaces that were PhD relevant were the [Public Code and Digital Public Goods devroom](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/public-code-and-digital-public-goods/). This room invites people from organisations like the UN, public healthcare, governments and government agencies and environmental org to speak on topics that are directly related to those spaces. In the past there have been more grassroots humanitarian and human rights technology organisations and individuals present in this space. 

**Reflection questions**

What impressions did the attendees have of design?
What questions were asked about design?
What content was brought to the explicitly design related spaces.
