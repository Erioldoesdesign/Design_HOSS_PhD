## Proposal
[Original Proposal](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/PhD-proposal-2020.md)

**Key aspects of the research**
This research will discover insights on the impact that design contributions have on HOSS and also the front-line users of HOSS tools.


## Case study structure
 
### 1st Case study contextual inquiry
Using Contexual inquiry methods, observe design in practice at one of the organisations.




### 2nd more experimental methods etc.



### 3rd pulling together the 2 previous case studies and applying what was learned in a knowledgeable way.
