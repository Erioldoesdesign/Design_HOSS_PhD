## Proposal
[Original Proposal](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/PhD-proposal-2020.md)

## Quick HOSS visualisation

_"Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS), or sometimes called Humanitarian FOSS, is open source software that somehow benefit the human condition in areas such as health care, economic development, disaster management, ecology, education and more."_

### Key aspects of the research

I've added an original proposal statement in bold and then key questions or revisions around that.

**A critical exploration in how human centred designers participate in and improve humanitarian Open Source Software.**
Q: Measurement for 'improve' need to be defined and by whom? the HOSS or the designer/s or both collaboratively?


**This research will critically explore how collaboration between human centred designers, people who manage Humanitarian Open Source Software (HOSS) and users of that software work towards improving the user-centred design of the HOSS. **

Q: "This research will critically explore designers contributions to HOSS to understand the impact that human centred design contributions have on HOSS and the front-line users of HOSS tools." < I think a critical aspect missed in the original proposal was about not just exploring how contribution from HCD to HOSS happens but also the impact on HOSS and Front-line users (FLU's) of HOSS. The means of participation is interesting but my hunch is in a humanitarian context the impact is a key indicator of 'worthwhileness' of the engagement overall.

**TBC rest of proposal review & rewrite**


### Original Research questions

What gaps can be identified in the ways that HOSS projects currently interact and communicate with designers and users that differ in their interaction and communication with engineers?  Gap analysis of HOSS, designer/s and user interactions and communications.

From these gaps, how can we inform designers, HOSS and users with complementary knowledge of each other in order to better collaborate? Testable information exchange structure between HOSS, Designer/s and users with M&E of the impact of the testable structure.

What mechanisms could support greater collaboration between stakeholders (HOSS, designers, users) to support HOSS to achieve results for communities in need of humanitarian assistance? Facilitated collaborative workshops.

Can we measure the impact of human-centred design on HOSS from these collaboration mechanisms? Statistical analysis of the impact HCD contributions have had on the HOSS, focusing on meeting user needs.

What does a peer-support, global, collaborative design community need in order to support itself when collaborating with and on HOSS? Qualitative data from stakeholders that informs recommendations for community structures that indenture healthy HCD contribution to HOSS.



# Case study structure
 
### 1st Case study contextual inquiry
Using Contexual inquiry methods, observe design in practice at one of the organisations.

_Contextual inquiry is usually employed when we want to capture a process in its natural setting; and generally used in situations where you want to capture nuances of the process that the users otherwise may not be able to articulate in an interview. Letâ€™s say, you want to understand how a fitness coach goes about his coaching in a way you want this to be developed into a software/ app. In this case, interviewing a coach may not be productive as the coach may not be able to retrospect and tell you all the nuances that are necessary. Further, interviewing the coach outside of fitness center setting may also not yield the right results. Employing contextual inquiry helps the researcher observe and probe at the same time; and document the process capturing all the details in their original setting._


### 2nd more experimental methods etc.
Action research or Auto ethnography
Perhaps this case study would be more 'hands on' and involved from my own pov. Choosing a methodology approach would be tricky here but some ideas include those more in the labs and co-creation 'quaderant'

### 3rd pulling together the 2 previous case studies and applying what was learned in a knowledgeable way.
Observations and contextual inquiry mixed with an auto ethonography or action research method.
Blending the two previous methods most likely.


## Criteria for OSS case study choices

The literature reviews I've been doing in my first few months have helped me to better understand what interventions and studies have been done with design, HCI, HCD and usability into *regular* OSS projects. By regular I mean that some of the FLOSS focussed on in these studies may have 'for good' goals and be of benefit to users and people but the explicit purpose of the FLOSS is *not* a humanitarian or human rights focus. From this I've been able to pull a criteria set for what might make a successful OSS + Design case study and I can apply similar/same criteria but to a HOSS project. 

A HOSS project would need to be able to be discerned by a set of criteria. This could possibly be whethr the HOSS project aims to solve a UN [HID](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi) or one or more [SDG's](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). There may be more criteria that can apply in certain cases. Especially those cases of HOSS that are not widely supported by an Int Dev org and is volunteer/contributor led like many OSS projects are. An example of this might be early years of Ushahidi which was created in a very traditional OSS fashion and then became a NGO that focused on Humanitarian development and SDG's as a way of sustaining their core team and operations.

## The choice of 'how invovled to be with the HOSS' case study
A tricky aspect of doing this research in this space is understanding the level of involvement that some HOSS project may expect (given the reading on design research within OSS) and whether to 'expect' similar needs. 
For example, many papers **(cite)** have described the process of designers, HCI experts and usability experts being involved in OSS via a design contribution as a long, involved and laboured process in order to be "successful" (success being measured by the design contributions being recieved, regarded well or positively, being included in comms and decision making and finally, design being processed through the development pipeline and structure through to permenance (or semi-permenance given the fluctuating/improvement focussed nature of design improvements). These insights from papers have also reflected my own personal experience being involved in different OSS, HOSS and FLOSS projects of varying kinds over the years as both a paid staff contributor and a volunteer contributer. 
More exploration into literature that describes any differences in HOSS or design within any humanitarian context or project would help understand if for any reason, HOSS has different expectations. So far as a designer who has contributed to both explicit HOSS projects (Ushahidi, Mutual Aid etc.) and 'for good' OSS projects (Open Food Network) I can say there are many similarities with the expectations from the OSS pov. From the humanitarian pov there are slightly different expectations and understandings. This could be characterised by a [conversation/interview I had with the UNHRC](https://github.com/ushahidi/opendesign/issues/95) regarding the [Open Design](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/opendesign) (forked repo from [Ushahidi's version of Open Design](https://github.com/ushahidi/opendesign) project back in 2019 where the UNHRC described 'being wary' of design (and technology) volunteers based off of a previous experience they had with a UK based volunteer organisation that 'wanted to help'. The UNHRC was optimistic but found the volunteers were not able to regard the inherent knowledge of the humaniatrian space the UNHRC was operating in and made big assumptions about what beneficiaries needs from technology without considering the UNHCR's knowledge and understanding.


## Timelines
If we are to take the above 'involvement criteria' into consideration case studies would need to be a number of years long and require 'trust building exercises' with both the OSS culture (developers, maintainers etc.) and with the Humanitarian works (program managers, NGO staff, field workers etc.).
Beginning to explore relationships with HOSS that are 'good candidates' for case studies will be key. Otherwise, these would need to be both HOSS and NGO/Orgs that are familiar and able to participate in research case studies which would likely exclude a number of smaller, under-resourced and under-funded HOSS.
Therefore, Casestudies are likely to take at least 2 years if not more to complete a trust cycle and research cycle.
It's possible incentives could improve this.


## Criteria for Humanitarian design
As well as criteria for Human Centred Designers contributiing to OSS and working in a humanitarian context there must be some consideration of what it means to 'design in a humanitarin way' or be 'humanitarian centred designs' or perhaps even 'Human rights centred designers'.

Below are a few resources and guidelines that I have found that have been published over recent years in order to provide designers with ways in which to produce design in a more 'humanitarian way'.

The social design cookbook has, on pages 48 to 63 some of what they call 'ingredients for social design cooperation' http://www.socialdesigncookbook.com/
They also published a ['social design canvas'](https://socialdesigncookbook.gumroad.com/l/howtousesocialdesigncanvas)
