### PhD research title
"How do human-centred designers currently contribute to Humanitarian Open Source Software (HOSS) and how is human-centred design viewed within HOSS?‚Äù
*A critical exploration in how human centred designers participate in and contribute to humanitarian Open Source Software.*


## How can you add ideas to Eriol's reasearch
If you're here, you've either been given this link by Eriol or found it by searching for research around design in OSS and/or Humanitarian/Human-Rights open technology. You can partcipate in this research in a number of ways:

1. Read through any [draft writing](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/tree/main/draft-articles-and-papers) or [finished papers](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/tree/main/final%20papers) and [create an issue](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/issues/new) with a thought, response, additional research etc.
2. If you think you or your OSS project/Humanitarian/Human-Rights organisation is relevant to this research please get in contact with Eriol on ther university email here: 
P.Reichelt2@newcastle.ac.uk
3. If you've participated in Eriol's PhD research and want to get an update on something specific then you may find the heavily anonymised version of data here on this GitHub. Please contact Eriol at 
P.Reichelt2@newcastle.ac.uk for any specific locations of where your contribution to this research is kept.
4. Any other comments or ideas you'd like to contribute to this research Eriol encourages you to put [in a new issue](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/issues/new).

## Ecosystems Mapping: Innovation in Humanitarian/Human-Rights organisations
This project is one of the first interview based research pieces for this PhD and the details introducing it can be found in [Ecosystem-mapping.md](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/ecosystem%20mapping%20Interviews/Ecosystem-mapping.md) and subsequent details found [in the folder](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/tree/main/ecosystem%20mapping%20Interviews)


## Hackathon Observations
This project is one of the first observation research pieces for this PhD and the details introducing it can be found in [hackathon-observation.md](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/Hackathon%20observation/hackathon-observation.md) and subsequent details found [in the folder](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/tree/main/Hackathon%20observation)


## Principles, ethical guidelines, impact, innovation and frameworks
This is where the discovery and writing work across the broad discovery (found when investigating the ecosystems research piece) that humanitarian and to a lesser extent human rights orgs, designers and some factions of OSS have ways of describing 'how' to do/conduct their work along a set of guidelines. These vary in formality and strictness e.g. the Humanitarian principles being more akin to a doctors hippocratic oath and an OSS license being very close but not equal to a product warranty or patent but more like a standard set by the social systems or regulatory body of OSS. Designers have the least monitored (either socially or by a standards body) set of principles or ethics (outside of an academic environment).

hra or hrd = Human Rights Activist/Defender
pd = Participatory Design
pra = Participatory Action Research
