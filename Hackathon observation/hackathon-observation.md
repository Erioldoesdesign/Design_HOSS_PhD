### [Innovation by design at UNICEF: An Ethnographic case study](https://www.academia.edu/16972372/Innovation_by_Design_at_UNICEF)

**Abstract**
An ethnographic case study of the Innovation Unit of UNICEF, the United Nations Children Fund, examines how design attitude approaches manifest within the innovation agendaof the organization. Our analysis illuminates key principles, practices and processes involved inthe programmatic implementation of the innovation mandate at UNICEF and reveals theemergent nature of modes of generative design responsible for new configurations of socialpractices. Thestudy confirms the positive impact of key design attitude dimensions in advancing processes oforganizational change and identifies a set of wins for design while also pointing to real barriersthat illustrate how these design modes remain at the edge of an uncharted territory. At the macro-level of analysis, two important findings of the study reside in elucidating how design attitude inthis organizational context of global innovation is impacted by the themes of accountability andurgency that govern the institutional logics of the organization.

## What the observation study intends to acheive

The purpose of this research is to critically explore how human-centred design is currently practiced and understood between by the people who
create and maintain Humanitarian Open Source Software (HOSS) and users of the HOSS. In addition, how do human-centred designers themselves,
engage with and contribute to HOSS and why.
The aim of this critical exploration is to better understand what practices support a collaborative, inclusive and human-centred design process for the
HOSS and if the use of the HOSS and relationship to the HOSS, by the beneficiaries, is changed through these human-centred design practices. 

This specific observation study is to first observe 3 hackathons that fit the following criteria:

1. The hackathon work will be done on an OSS with a license.
2. The hackathon has a design presence to it e.g. has asked for design contribution or mentioned design in some clear way
3. The hackathon encourages and facilitates participation from technologists that identify as part of the community that the OSS benefits e.g. Refugees for refugee related technology
4. The hackathon organisers agree for the hackathon to be observed and agree to the processes laid out in this ethics application.

The second part of this study will be to participate in 1 hackathon that also covers the above criteria.

I will capture and measure the information and data from observations of the hackathon to compare and analyse differences and similarities across a number of metrics such as: Collaboration, successful issue/task completion, participation of designers etc.

Examples of these hackathons are:

The second piece of the observational study practice is to observe how the non-live, text-based humanitarian and human rights OSS tool repositories of 'issues' (tasks for OSS developers and other contributors) develop their discussions and understanding of design and designers along with what processes, methods and tools designers use to encourage collaboration.
