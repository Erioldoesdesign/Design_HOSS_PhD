### Project title: 
**Observing Human-centred Design Contributions to Humanitarian/Human Rights Open Source Software:** _What collaborations, conversations, processes and cultures are at play between designers, OSS projects, humanitarian/human rights organisations and their beneficiaries._

The purpose of this research was to critically explore how human-centred design is currently practiced and understood between by the people who create and maintain Humanitarian/Human Rights related Open Source Software (HOSS) and users of the HOSS. In addition, how do human-centred designers themselves, engage with and contribute to HOSS and why.
The aim of this critical exploration was to better understand what practices support a collaborative, inclusive and human-centred design process for the HOSS and if the use of the HOSS and relationship to the HOSS, by the beneficiaries, is changed through these human-centred design practices. 

This specific observation study was to first observe hackathons that fit the following criteria:

1. The hackathon work will be done on an OSS with a license.
2. The hackathon has a design presence to it e.g. has asked for design contribution or mentioned design in some clear way
3. The hackathon encourages and facilitates participation from technologists that identify as part of the community that the OSS benefits e.g. Refugees for refugee related technology
4. The hackathon organisers agree for the hackathon to be observed and agree to the processes laid out in this ethics application.

The second part of this study will was to participate in 1 hackathon that also covers the above criteria.

The second piece of the observational study practice was to observe how the non-live, text-based humanitarian and human rights OSS tool repositories of 'issues' (tasks for OSS developers and other contributors) develop their discussions and understanding of design and designers along with what processes, methods and tools designers use to encourage collaboration along with any communications platforms outside of these repositories. Repositories are open and public and can be observed without notifying the communities, however many of these communities use communications platforms that are either open (matrix https://matrix.org/) or IRC chats (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)

As a participant in a hackathon/event or a contributor to HOSS, your behaviour, conversations and discussions would have been observed by the researcher and included within the wider PhD's inisght


Thank you for your agreement to be observed in this research.


### What will happen to my information?

Observations of the participants and organisations will be collected in the form of written/typed notes, transcription, video recording and audio recording will be located on a secure laptop owned by the researcher and a fully anonymised version will be hosted on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD) under an [open source creative commons license](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/LICENSE.md) for written research and GPL or Apache or MIT for any future software code written.
Any subsequent written information offered by the participant/s will be located in local documents they have created, on the same secure device they own and sent to the researchers aforementioned secure device and only if they are either currently publicly accessible or written permission has been given to the researcher in order to use as evidence. 

Any subsequent written information offered by yourself as the research participants will be located in documents you have created, on the same secure devive owned by the researcher and anonymised versions hosted on the previously mentioned github repository. It is your responsibility to erase any documents and traces of documents from your own device should you want to.

All collected information can be checked by yourself (the participant) prior to hosting on github to ensure accuracy and anonymisation is satisfactory.
The information collected from observations will inform the wider research on the PhD project. 


### Why is this data needed?**

The participants information will be used to inform the wider understanding of designâ€™s (and designers) place within Humanitarian/Human Rights open source software and will inform ongoing research to be produced in a final paper. No information will lead to any possible privacy breach or identification of participants. The results of the project may be used for a future research as part of the same PhD. Without this first-hand data we're working on past examples and andecdotal data which has questionable validity.
This observational data is needed in order to ensure a diverse and inclusive account of how people within humanitarian and human rights organisations collaborate with design and designers on their HOSS. Without this first-hand data we're working on past examples and anecdotal data which has questionable validity.

### Who do I contact if I have questions about the project?**

Contact Eriol Fox, PhD researcher on this project at P.Reichelt2@newcastle.ac.uk if there are any concerns or queries related to the project. If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about Eriol as part of this project please contact [Supervisor or University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/rachelclarke.html)
