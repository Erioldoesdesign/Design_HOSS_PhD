Writing and reflection on what is happening in the humanitarian tech space


### The 'cynical space' where aid, tech, and militaries intersect

This articlebegins with commens that Humanitarian systems and military systems are closesly linked in terms of data.

*“A cynical space where the lines between humanitarian and military digital systems gets increasingly blurred, as data is funneled through the same platforms and anonymity loses any meaning.”*

*People living in crisis are often mined for their information. When a person arrives at a displacement camp, they may be put in a situation where they must barter their personal data to access lifesaving aid such as food.*
This quote exposes the complex relationship people that are displaced/refugees have with humanitarian orgs and their collection of 'data'.

*For example, the World Food Programme’s SCOPE is one of the largest data management systems in the humanitarian sector and has the personal data of more than 63 million people.* they go on to state that many different orgs are collect similar or the same data in order to distribute aid (mostly) *Individuals are not just providing their data to one group — there are often many different groups within any camp asking for details to provide support ranging from the provision of tents and hygiene products to mental health counseling.*


*“Humanitarian data might be more financially valuable than it is operationally useful, and AI companies might need humanitarian and development data more than aid actors actually need their AI prototypes,” Coppi told Devex.*

A large part of this article articulates concerns with how 'sellable' data is of people that may have been historically 'not-datafied' so have been using no or minimal technology up until displacement by disaster.

*“There cannot be meaningful consent when your life depends on giving away your data,” he said.*

This poses a potential ethical challenge to my PhD should I be expecting to work with 'beneficiaries' directly through co-design, participatory action research, participatory design and liberatory design and living labs as my approaches to research.
