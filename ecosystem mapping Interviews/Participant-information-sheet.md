### Project title: 
**"How do human-centred designers currently contribute to Humanitarian Open Source Software (HOSS) and how is human-centred design viewed within HOSS?‚Äù**
_A critical exploration in how human centred designers participate in and contribute to humanitarian Open Source Software._

---

**Dear Participant,**

You are invited to participate in the research project described below.

**What is the project about?**
The purpose of this research is to explore how human-centred design is currently practiced and understood between by the people who create and maintain Humanitarian Open Source Software (HOSS) and users of HOSS. In addition, how do human-centred designers themselves, engage with and contribute to HOSS and why. HOSS and 'open projects' may often be categorised as 'innovation'.
The aim of this critical exploration is to better understand what practices support a collaborative, inclusive and human-centred design process for the HOSS and if the use of the HOSS and relationship to the HOSS, by the beneficiaries, is changed through these human-centred design practices.

This research ask you, the participant to comment on your experiences, knowledge and ideas from both your individual perspective, your role in your organisations perspective and your wider organisational perspective.
