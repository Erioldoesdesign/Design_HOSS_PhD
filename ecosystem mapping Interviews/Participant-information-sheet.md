### Project title: 
**"How do human-centred designers currently contribute to Humanitarian Open Source Software (HOSS) and how is human-centred design viewed within HOSS?‚Äù**
_A critical exploration in how human centred designers participate in and contribute to humanitarian Open Source Software._

---

**Dear Participant,**

You are invited to participate in the research project described below.

**What is the project about?**
The purpose of this research is to explore how human-centred design is currently practiced and understood between by the people who create and maintain Humanitarian Open Source Software (HOSS) and users of HOSS. In addition, how do human-centred designers themselves, engage with and contribute to HOSS and why. HOSS and 'open projects' may often be categorised as 'innovation'.
The aim of this critical exploration is to better understand what practices support a collaborative, inclusive and human-centred design process for the HOSS and if the use of the HOSS and relationship to the HOSS, by the beneficiaries, is changed through these human-centred design practices.

This research ask you, the participant to comment on your experiences, knowledge and ideas from both your individual perspective, your role in your organisations perspective and your wider organisational perspective.


**Why am I being invited to participate?**

You have been asked to participate due to your current or past work or involvement in humanitarian or human-rights work. You may have worked at a large international organisation or a smaller local organisation, in either a paid or unpaid capacity. In this research we want to hear and understand the perspectives of those that have been involved in humanitarian and human-rights organisations in a broad sense. You may have operated particularly within an innovation, technology, design/product management or user/beneficiary role.


**What will I be asked to do?**

For 1hr 30mins of your time over a secure video/audio call online, with PhD researcher Eriol Fox and a note taking assistant. Where we will start with understanding better what your role is (or was) which will lead into a discussion informed by key questions that investigate your experiences and understanding of humanitarian innovation and how technology is used (or not used) in your organisation along with how you work with users/beneficiaries.

We may ask for a follow up session if we find we could not cover the detail needed for the key questions and this will either be in the form of an additional video/audio call but can also be facilitated through written responses in a secure shared document or encyrpted emails.


**How much time will the project take?**

The interview will take 1.5 hours. Corrospondance and any follow up will take between 1 month prior to interview and up to 2 weeks post interview to schedule and arrange.

There may be a case where the researcher contact you to do further research activities of a different nature that may take longer periods of time.


**Are there any risks associated with participating in this project?**

This project asks you to talk about your current or past involvement in humanitarian or human-rights work and therefore understands that there is some information that may need to be abstracted and redacted from the transcription and notes. Any confidential or sensitive information about any humanitarian/human-rights organisations that is noted as being sensitive or classified will not be noted in any documents that can be associated with any individual. Sensitive or classified information that can be used by abstracted will be passed back to the interviewee for clearing before being used within research findings. Any information about individual beneficiaries or people that are recipients of humanitarian/human-rights support or aid will be anonymised and abstrated. 
Please consider you own level or organisational or professional risk prior to this project.
There will likely be questions and subjects where you will be asked to refer to past projects in the organisations that you participated in. These can be highly traumatic events to recall and recount information of and the reseracher will be ensuring as much duty of care to the interviewees comfort and health as possible which will include:
* Asking if you need to stop or take breaks during the interview
* Asking and ensuring you have adequate care pre and post interview
*
