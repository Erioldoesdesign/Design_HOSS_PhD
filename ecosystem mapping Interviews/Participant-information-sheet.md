**Dear Participant,**

You are invited to participate in the research project described below.

**What is the project about?**

The purpose of this research is to explore how people that work within humanitarian and human rights organisations describe and understand 'innovation' within their specific organisational context, how they view other organisation and related 'innovation'. We'll be exploring this along with the connection to users, beneficiaries and partner organisations.

This is in order to better understand what practices support a collaborative, inclusive and human-centred design process for the technologies in use by humanitarian and human rights organisations and if the use of the HOSS and relationship to the HOSS, by the beneficiaries, is changed through these human-centred design practices.

This research ask you, the participant to comment on your experiences, knowledge and ideas from both your individual perspective, your role in your organisations perspective and your wider organisational perspective.


**What is the benefit to the community that your project is trying to achieve?**

This project is trying to better achieve a clear understanding and subsequent mapping of the ecosystem of innovation, including the understanding of innovation which may differ from organisation to organisation and person to person. The aim with this project is the results of the participant conversations and mapping exercises will be able to draw clearer distinctions and correlations between information from participants that can be beneficial to their own growing understanding and practice in the area of innovation.

**Why am I being invited to participate?**

You have been asked to participate due to your current or past work or involvement in humanitarian or human rights work. You may have worked at a large international organisation or a smaller local organisation, in either a paid or unpaid capacity. In this research we want to hear and understand the perspectives of those that have been involved in humanitarian and human rights organisations in a broad sense. You may have operated particularly within an innovation, technology, design/product management or user/beneficiary role. You'll also be aged 18+ and able to give legal, informed consent to participate.


**What will I be asked to do?**

For 1hr 30mins of your time over a secure video/audio call online, with PhD researcher Eriol Fox and a note taking assistant. Where we will start with understanding better what your role is (or was) which will lead into a discussion informed by key questions that investigate your experiences and understanding of humanitarian innovation and how technology is used (or not used) in your organisation along with how you work with users/beneficiaries.

We may ask for a follow up session if we find we could not cover the detail needed for the key questions and this will either be in the form of an additional video/audio call but can also be facilitated through written responses in a secure shared document or encyrpted emails. This will not be more than 1hr of additional time.

We will then ask for a further 1hr of your time between 2 and 6 weeks after your interview to review the findings of the interview and the associations that the researcher has made between your insights and wider humanitarian and human-rights ecosystems.


**How much time will the project take?**

The interview will take 1hr 30mins. Corrospondance and any follow up will take between 1 month prior to interview and up to 2 weeks post interview to schedule and arrange.

There may be a case where the researcher contact you to do further research activities of a different nature that may take longer periods of time.


**Are there any risks associated with participating in this project?**

This project asks you to talk about your current or past involvement in humanitarian or human-rights work and therefore understands that there is some information that may need to be abstracted and redacted from the transcription and notes. Any confidential or sensitive information about any humanitarian/human-rights organisations that is noted as being sensitive or classified will not be noted in any documents that can be associated with any individual. Sensitive or classified information that can be used by abstracted will be passed back to the interviewee for clearing before being used within research findings. Any information about individual beneficiaries or people that are recipients of humanitarian/human-rights support or aid will be anonymised and abstrated. 
Please consider you own level or organisational or professional risk prior to this project.

There will likely be questions and subjects where you will be asked to refer to past projects in the organisations that you participated in. These can be highly traumatic events to recall and recount information of and the reseracher will be ensuring as much duty of care to the interviewees comfort and health as possible which will include:
* Asking if you need to stop or take breaks during the interview
* Asking and ensuring you have adequate care pre and post interview
* Esuring any sensitive data is redacted or not captured in notes or heavily abstracted to the satisfaction of the participant
* The project will be conducted in English but if a pariticpant requires translation efforts will be made to seek effective translation
* There may be participants that have accessibility needs and efforts to ensure comfortable ability to participate will be made

**Any extra vulnerable groups we need to consider?**

We may be talking with people who are actively at risk in their countries or residence in relation to the work that they do in the humanitarian and/or human rights space and we will be ensuring there are decentralised spaces in order to have conversations with high risk participants.

**Can I withdraw from the project?**

At any point you can withdraw yourself from the interview process and wider project by asking for all data and information both digital and non-digital to be destroyed within 30 days in relation to [Article 17 of GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/?cn-reloaded=1). This withdrawl does not require any supplimentary information with the request for withdrawl.


**What will happen to my information?**

Your information will be used to inform an 'ecosystem map' of innovation and related term within humanitarian and human rights work and will be produced in a final paper. No information will lead to any possible privacy breach or identification of participants. The results of the project may be used for a future extension project. 

Your information responses to the interview will be collected in the form of written/typed notes, transcription, video recording and audio recording will be located on a secure laptop owned by the researcher and a fully anonymised version will be hosted on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD) under an [open source creative commons license](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/LICENSE.md). Any subsequent written information offered by yourself as the research participants will be located in documents you have created, on the same secure devive owned by the researcher and anonymised versions hosted on the previously mentioned github repository. It is your responsibility to erase any documents and traces of documents from your own device should you want to.
All collected information can be checked by yourself (the participant) prior to hosting on github to ensure accuracy and anonymisation is satisfactory.
The information collected from these interviews will inform the wider research on the PhD project stated in the title.

**Why is this data needed?**

This data is needed in order to ensure a diverse and inclusive account of how people within humanitarian and human rights organisations view innovation and who innovation affects. Without this first-hand data we're working on past examples and andecdotal data which has questionable validity.

**Who do I contact if I have questions about the project?**

Contact Eriol Fox, PhD researcher on this project at P.Reichelt2@newcastle.ac.uk if there are any concerns or queries related to the project. If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about Eriol as part of this project please contact [Supervisor or University]

**If I want to participate, what do I do?**

You will first need to fill out a [Consent Form](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/ecosystem%20mapping%20Interviews/consent-form.md). Once that is complete and recieved by Eriol then you can proceed to schedule a time slot for the 1hr 30mins interview with Eriol Fox who will ensure that the time is in calendars and all the appropriate administration is completed. The interview will then be conducted where you will attend either online or in person (if COVID-19 restrictions allow) and then you may want to check any subsequent information is satisfactorily accurate and anonymised. There may be a follow up request for more information through the communication method that you are comfortable with which you can accept or decline.


Yours sincerely,
Eriol Fox
