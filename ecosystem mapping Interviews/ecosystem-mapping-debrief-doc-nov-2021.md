### Project title: 
**"The innovation ecosystem within Humanitarian and Human rights organisations**
_Understanding the connections between, innovation, technology, design and openness from the perspective of worker in organisations.”_ 

This experiment is designed to examine… Previous work has shown that… Here, our interest was in…

The experiment employs a within-participants design with two conditions. The independent variable is whether the spatial sequence presented to participants is a Hebb effect sequence (one repeated every third trial) or a novel sequence. The dependent variable is the percentage of a sequence correctly recalled by a participant on each trial. 

The purpose of the statistical analysis is to determine whether the repeated sequence stimuli produce significantly greater learning than the control stimuli. Because we are looking for an implicit memory effect any participants who indicate that they were explicitly aware of the repeated sequence will be excluded from the analysis. For each participant we will calculate the mean percentage recalled for the Hebb sequences and for the novel trials immediately preceding each Hebb sequence. We will then conduct a repeated measures t-test across all thirty participants (minus any exclusions) comparing the percentage scores for the Hebb sequence against the percentage scores for the control sequences. If the experimental hypothesis is supported there will be a significant difference between both conditions. The null hypothesis is that there will be no significant difference.
