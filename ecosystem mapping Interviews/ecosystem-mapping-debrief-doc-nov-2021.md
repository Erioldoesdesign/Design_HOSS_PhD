## Participant debrief sheet

### Project title: 
**"The innovation ecosystem within Humanitarian and Human rights organisations**
_Understanding the connections between, innovation, technology, design and openness from the perspective of worker in organisations.‚Äù_ 

This experiment is designed to explore how people that work within humanitarian and human rights organisations describe and understand 'innovation' within their specific organisational context, how they view other organisation and related 'innovation'. We'll be exploring this along with the connection to users, beneficiaries and partner organisations. Previous work has shown that innovation is often understood as technology, but we want to understand what other ways innovation is understood in humanitarian and human rights organisations and innovative technology can be connected to how 'open' and 'open source' that technology is. Innovation in both a technology sense and a broader sense is dependant on a series of factors including: Roles, Routines, Resources, Relationships, Results and Rules as well as the organisational structure (adhocratic, holocratic, sociocratic etc.). Previous work has also discovered the positive impact of key design attitude dimensions in advancing processes of organizational change and innovation. Here, our interest was to better understand what practices and attitudes support a collaborative, inclusive and human-centred design process for the technologies in use by humanitarian and human rights organisations and if the use of the HOSS and relationship to the HOSS, by the beneficiaries, is changed through these human-centred design practices.

The purpose of the ecosystem mapping interviews is to hear the direct and indirect perspectives and experiences of individuals within humanitarian and human rights organisations on the key themes of innovation, open source, design and collaboration efforts. Because we are looking for aconnections between innovation, technology, open source and design processes, practices and attitudes around collaboration and the subsequent effect on innovation.
For each participant we will note, transcribe and map their comments to the interview questions. The researchers then preliminarlity mapped the results and followed up with the participants in a further session to confirm, modifiy and discuss the mapping in order to identify any inconsistenties and provoke a 'co-mapping' appraoch. We will then write up key results and findings from the ecosystem mapping.

Thank you for your time.


**What will happen to my information?**

Your information will be used to inform an 'ecosystem map' of innovation and related term within humanitarian and human rights work and will be produced in a final paper. No information will lead to any possible privacy breach or identification of participants. The results of the project may be used for a future extension project. 

Your information responses to the interview will be collected in the form of written/typed notes, transcription, video recording and audio recording will be located on a secure laptop owned by the researcher and a fully anonymised version will be hosted on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD) under an [open source creative commons license](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/LICENSE.md). Any subsequent written information offered by yourself as the research participants will be located in documents you have created, on the same secure devive owned by the researcher and anonymised versions hosted on the previously mentioned github repository. It is your responsibility to erase any documents and traces of documents from your own device should you want to.
All collected information can be checked by yourself (the participant) prior to hosting on github to ensure accuracy and anonymisation is satisfactory.
The information collected from these interviews will inform the wider research on the PhD project stated in the title.

**Why is this data needed?**

This data is needed in order to ensure a diverse and inclusive account of how people within humanitarian and human rights organisations view innovation and who innovation affects. Without this first-hand data we're working on past examples and andecdotal data which has questionable validity.

**Who do I contact if I have questions about the project?**

Contact Eriol Fox, PhD researcher on this project at P.Reichelt2@newcastle.ac.uk if there are any concerns or queries related to the project. If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about Eriol as part of this project please contact [Supervisor or University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/rachelclarke.html)
