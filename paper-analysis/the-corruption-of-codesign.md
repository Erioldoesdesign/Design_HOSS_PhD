This is the SQ3R Processing for Otto Von Busch and Karl Palmas as the corruption of Co-Design, political and social complex in participatory design, thinking, the first stage is survey. 

We're going to skim or scan through a chapter we're gonna skim and scan through each chapter, note headings and sub headings, and any other outstanding features, like figures and tables or summary paragraphs.

## Chapter is 1. Introduction

### Sub-heading - The problems of participatory design

*Question: What are the problems of participatory design? And does this introduction even begin to cover them or explain them?*

The first section details designers doing things in studios, hypothetical scenarios.

We are looking for the problems of participatory design.
The first problem of participatory design on the first page appears to be how real life users the best planned social scenarios.
So this is where real life reality combats the idealistic structures of how we perform design.

What happens along the way with all the good intentions. So I think this is suggesting that real life interferes or engages with or interrupts good intentions, and that one of the problems of participatory design is good intentions, and how it interplays with rural life.

Another problem with participatory design is described as lofty ambitions for understanding and shaping societal processes. Claiming to re design cultures themselves, scenarios of design are stepping into ethical dilemmas.

Designers are intending to shape social societal settings towards virtuous ends.

Design is described as making humans more godlike. The way of describing this process is design enables a godlike interaction or view of society, and therefore maybe these passages, suggesting that the bright and virtuous future, as written in the text, appears more achievable than it is realistic.

There is a clear section where that states, the designers themselves may be misled or ill-equipped to act and affect power dynamics. So perhaps the problem here is the description of how design interacts with power dynamics. And does it interact with power? Dynamics is suggesting that designers are not equipped to engage with power dynamics that exist in the real world and that often the way that designers interact with the real world is using the kinds of words like participation, function, beauty, democratic design, peace, justice. But the terms are simply that they are just words that are used within the function of design without a grounding. 

In reality social design specifically is seen as the way to tackle the injustices of the world.
But without the grounding in reality, as  described earlier in this subheading, and that designers are now realising these are more than wicked problems in quotation marks.

They are real systemic issues and social issues. They are realist issues. There's a relation to outside of the field of design, feminist thinking thinkers with real list inclinations have highlighted the conflict as a core political mechanism which is commonly silenced to uphold consensus and power.

Sarah Ahmed, bell hooks, and Chantal Mouffe work is a central reference on design and the political.

Then there is a quite blatant sentence about Scandinavian participative design being most or more problematic as a tradition of design which treasures inclusion and care without the understanding that participate. Participation is political, and participation is grounded in realism, although the there is a suggestion that design fabricates a sort of pocket dimension of idealism that is not helpful or realist.


### Sub-heading - Scandinavians mugged by reality. 
*Question: what happened to Scandinavians within the context of participatory design?*

Here is having read this book already, and then going through this process. Here's where we get the first mention of reality, which will become a important term throughout the rest of the book.
This is going into reality and more specific terms. My question is, what happened to Scandinavians within the context of participatory design which was briefly addressed in the heading of problems, the problems of participatory design.

Which is that Scandinavian participative design is tradition, or as traditional in some way.

Looking under Scandinavians mugged by reality, heading this details University of Gothenburg's School of design and crafts an incident with a gun and shooting what happened to Scandinavians with the context of participatory design. Apparently this peaceful 70 years the country of Sweden establish it established itself as a model of social democracy, based on consensual agreements and consensual spirit. And this underpins the political economic arrangement and it served the citizens well during the post-war era.

It was Sweden was regarded as one of the wealthiest, equal, and equitable societies.

There was a meeting where people/organizations pushed back against Washington, based consensus corporate led corporate led neoliberalization globalization.

There were protests.It was near the School of Design. The world leaders criticise the Gothenburg model of consensual spirit. Given this protest happened, and they challenged this romantic approach to dealing with the threat of violence re-protesters the violence of the protest had done irreparable damage to the dream of building a democratic society based on dialogue and broad participation.

Apparently in the minds of these various kind of world powers and organizational powers. World Bank. WTO. World Trade Organization, IMF. The International Monetary Fund, Ministerial Conference in Seattle Global Justice Movement, these kinds of and the George W. Bush, President and European Council.

Other people have challenged that Scandinavian participatory design is concerned with that very challenge of how to cope with the political realities of the democratic and social system in retreat.

Apparently there are 2 significant ironies, but they are hard to parse in the text with some incongruent ideas and how they bring in to concern radical social theory.

That the approaches are founded on a social ontology that understands and relates to the world of this as if it were a motor exodus, is the political strategy in which changes achieved through the exit from mainstream institutions and simultaneous building of parallel institutions.

There is some discussion of the Hacker ethic.

This subheading is mostly quite confusing, though, doesn't necessarily I understand now what happened to the Scandinavians within that context. But the theory is a convoluted thing that has happened to you. Various Scandinavian institutions, politics, structures, design, etc.


### Sub-heading - The reality of social design

*Question: So this is hopefully going to give some examples of real applications of social design, maybe in relation to the Scandinavian context*

Should we strive for Utopias? Should we engage with politics.
Should we worry about the corruption of noble ideas in the decay of social order? 
What is the place of naive beliefs in equal belief, belief in politics, idealism, realism.

How does that affect or assert the theory and practice of design which in the book is described as being based on an idealist account of the world.

There is an assertion that the next section of the chapter reinforces that design is a practice based on idealism.

There is also a question here which is, why should designers or design theorists, for that matter, care about the logic of social change and political action which is relating back to how design attempts social change at the heart of it.

But that the techniques are based in idealism, not realism. Therefore it can't make meaningful interventions.

There is mention of the arts and craft movements and industrial design profession.
Which specifically is aimed at building a coherent, harmonious environment.

Social design is a process in which the main design object is social.

There's a diagram in this chapter which reinforces the idea, the design and design early ways of building participatory social design. Co-creation is the barest tip of the intervention of into the real problem which is rooted in complex society politics.

There's some references and writing about how designers engage with the human and beginning with people.

There's notably, a reference of using ideas of open works and systems, which is Alexander. 1977; Chermayeff, 1982.

The desire to transcend, transcend the authoritarian and expert ruled past instead implement the ideals of democracy, and is also visible in design more universal and participatory. 

The 7 Principles of universal design.
Universal design is good design, which is Rossetti. 2006

Ideal driven design applied to the social world is good.

There's then a suggestion that design breaks the technocratic Utopianism.
I'm reading this in the way that it design is the mechanism to which real people can participate in technocratic systems.
And designers that attend to such social callings would need training that teaches them to act beyond design the typical design brief.

Social designers require something different in their practice.

A section about Ezio Manzini, who wrote a good book that I've yet to finish about social innovation and design. Then, some references that Manzini makes around unsustainable directions.

So far, there's no real examples of the applications of social design. But there is a lot of theoretical background of how design interacts with the social and various principles and various responses to that in this chapter about user centric approaches, social context being reduced, primary primarily. Take the side of the user, losing important grounding within. One might as assume the realist and the political.

Such realism may provide a richer description of the nature of the social that designers are increasingly engaging with.


### Sub-heading  - The structure of the argument 

*Question: does this give me a better structure to the argument of the reality of social design within the context of Scandinavia?*

The questions in this section are.
Does this give me a better structure to the argument of the reality of social design within the context of Scandinavian design.

Does this give me a better structure? The first section that gives me less of a better, less referencing, a better structure, and more about an argument which is a reference to design scholarly design pursuits, putting an undue emphasis on idealistic understandings about what design is about.

It's reinforcing the previous 2 subheadings.

It says there's going to be a case study from the field with new empirics.

This is basically just giving the layout of the book.

I think the structure of the argument is literally just the structure of this book as opposed to the argument around the realities of social design. In the context.

It literally is just a review of the book structure chapters. though it does give a snapshot into some of the topics that have yet to be kind of even touched on in the book which the things that have been touched on in the book so far are some of the groundings of social participatory design, and the history, realism, and realist thinking in a and political theory and the idealism of design. But this subheading begins to talk about some of the processes of co-design and the notion of betrayal

In whose interest is the design being performed?

The biggest section is around chapter 3, which is the betrayal chapter.

The only other section that I've noted here is in the summary for Chapter 5 of cunning. where it talks about design for government or design in emerging models of governance. is a section stating that the chapter specifically interrogates how the imperative of empathy is deployed as a means to transform citizens with rights into users, with needs which is maybe playing into that idealism, historical tendency, and less in the realism.

It then suggests in the last the summary of the last chapter of hypocrisy that can a designer grounded in realism or a realist designer practice design in good faith, not necessarily good design, because there has been a lot of already a lot of debunking, of good design or design for good.


## Next chapter is 2. Realist challenge 

### Sub-heading - power and possibilities

*Question: what the power and the possibilities actually are?*

The writer draws attention to all of the students in one particular project presentation, stating the same kind of formula. Look here, there is an issue. I researched the concerns of the stakeholders made surveys. Here are some ways to frame and address the issue. And this is the design process shows a preferred suggestion to redesign the situation. That that's the formula that was repeated and the subsequent critique were also followed a formula that was predictable.

The thing that is lacking is the competing interests of like real reality.

It was as if the whole room had tactically agreed on sidelining, or at least ignoring the most vested and dollar rich interests in the region, and globally.

So it seems like there was a lack of understanding that the best of intentions don't always pan out design can't simply change society no matter how well it's designed. Sometimes it's a fluke design projects. Even those with critical or political aspirations work in worlds seen through idealistic tangent glasses.

The world is corrupt, citizens are portrayed, and politicians hypocritical.

So I suppose the power is in the established norms, and the possibilities are working within those norms, and being more realistic in response to those norms as opposed to this idealist view that is consistently talked about in the book.


### Sub-heading - The realist challenge

*Question: Does this go into more depth about the actual challenges of being realistic?*

Challenging the idealism that serves the dominant paradigm within contemporary design is difficult and that there are reasons why design. Practitioners adopt an idealist position.

Idealism, trades, impossibilities. Realism, on the other hand, trades in impossibilities and highlights, the limited space feasible.

The natural sciences are concerned with how things are. Design is concerned with how things ought to be.

One of my big questions for the Phd. Is how grounded in realism is humanitarian work and human rights work, or how grounded in idealism is it but similar in a similar way? How grounded in realism or idealism is open source software.

And it's intentions for the humanitarian human rights purposes. So if design is historically as per this text, grounded in an idealistic view.

Is it clashing with the realism of, say, open source software, and how that is made with the realism of some humanitarian human rights organizations.

And are there other ways of balancing idealism, realism?
Who? What do the stakeholders, the people, the users subscribe to? If any of those?

Are there conditions for humanitarian human rights work that doesn't allow for idealism or realism or any one or the other.

The chapter then goes on to say, there are constructive ways to present. Realist challenges.

Challenge to design for it. Realist thought already resides in contemporary design thought.
It's not necessarily about making design firmly rooted in realism is about addressing the blindness that design shares with idealistic perspectives and a willful ignorance and rejection of power politics.

It then goes on to talk about Machiavelli politics.

There's then some contrasting political philosophy from Bernard Williams, and moralists. They represent priority over the moral of the moral, over the political.

Given that categories such as justice and rights, tend to be general and all-encompassing moralists tend to lean towards a Universalist understanding of political virtues. Realists, on the other hand, tend to pay closer attention to the particular situation in which politics unfolds.

Thus moralists believe that general conceptions of justice and rights cut across local specific specific specificities related to particular power arrangements, realists, realists, on the other hand, insist that the particularities of a given power relation override Universalist moral claims.

There's then some talk about the Victor Papanek that wrote 'Design for real world' book.

### Sub-heading - The idealism of design thought

*Question: That is likely to kind of give some historical context around design thinking? with the lens of idealism.*

So far we've had no other significant things other than headings. 

It first starts to talk about how crucial it is for designers to find ways of accounting for the deceptive, unpredictable, recalcitrant nature of social reality and how the realist position within political theory serves as a useful resource.

This, then, refers to idealism in design, being returning to via Herbert Simon's influential text on the sciences of the artificial. It's a series of idealistic propositions that are inferred from Simon's writing that a designer is someone who devises courses of actions aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. Simon, 1996, page 111.

There are, and other references to different texts about human intentions and how engineering is a quintessential revolution revolutionary activity?

Is change possible or impossible?
Or to what extent is the social reality the place of the human and is reality malleable.

There's, some talk about the forces of inherent human nature.
Machiavelli's words of warning. The innovator has all those who benefit from the old orders as enemies.

How do we know that preferred is better than what is currently existing?

This requires the existence of a clear conception of virtue or of the good.

By whom is the preferred option wanted?

Then it goes on to talk about who it holds the power, and who is subject to the power can design be a truly universalistic Universalist endeavor. Given that designers are expected to produce good or preferable outcomes the client has preferences, and it is a designer's job to fulfil them, and there is a reference to Simon 1996, at page 153, as society as the client which to me

I've noted as is this like open source software communities our society as the client.

Many forms of inclusiveness may come at the cost of the “lambs” (users) which is.
“Who 'does' what to whom for whose benefit?” Geuss, 2008

There is then, some writing about capitalism and how realism may come across as a killjoy philosophy that prohibits action and creation.

### Sub-heading - Towards real politik.

*Question: what is real politik. and why is it so important?*

Real politics, real politics is on a more abstract level concerted, move away from the perspective of politics as mere application of rational, rational ethics and moral philosophy. Realism is interested in the brute facts of power, struggle, and violence that's separating the political from the moral.

Real, politic, realpolitik as John Bew, 2016 calls it, was crafted by as a practical tool for coping with the contradictory political problems produced by modernsay.

Real politics does not move in a foggy future, but in the present field of vision it does not consider its task to consist in the realization of ideas but in the entertainment, attainment of concrete ends.

Sentimental, politic.

Von Rochau, articulates 4 points that may form a schematic heuristic for coping with the real world.

I've made a note that these sound like governance. In relation to open source software. 

1. Who holds a power in any given circumstance. Note that this is distinct from who claims sovereignty and the right to hold power?

2. What are the social and economic conditions that underlie the political system? And how are they changing the distribution of power? 

3. What is the prevailing cultural context? And I've made a note open source software. And what are the most important ideological undercurrents of the society in question.

4. Considering all these things together, what is the room afforded for political action to forward one's interests or one's ideals. And what are the risks?

Innovation is equal to idealism. In one section of this chapter.


## Next chapter is 3. Betrayal

### Sub-heading - Post political participation 

*Question: What is post political participation. And why is it significant that it is post political, not pre-political or during political? What is the nature of post-political.*

The first part of this subheading describes a moment within a project where a team comes to a realization around a local area having a constitution having its own constitution, flexible programming, etc. and that the newspapers reported on it very differently to how they perceived it internally.

This chapter interrogates how co-design practices may actually suppress contestability. Examines how participative design and co-design, when used in the context of urban design specifically has been accused of being post-political choreography.

It doesn't really address what it is. Why, it's significant and the nature of it.

### Sub-heading - Agnostic and adversarial design. 

I've heard the term adversarial design for agnostic design I'm assuming is kind of a design that doesn't really care very much either way.

This begins with the tension between idealism, realism, and realism outlined in 2 opening chapters of this book.

It's reinforcing that this beginning of this book is drawing out the key tensions between idealism and realism which we have already discovered.

It then goes on to talk about agnosticism around, how order is created and notions of agnostic, agnostic design and adversarial design.

What does it mean for designers to distance themselves from the ideals of cosy consensual world. and base their practice on harsh realities of a world in disagreement can design disclose a world of power. Asymmetries hidden from view in seemingly consensual discourses, systems, and material arrangements.

Design can be, or may be, used as a means to generate non violent discursive disagreement.

Then goes on within a quote from Ehn and Hillgren in 2012b

to talk about how specifically the design, research or role becomes one of infrastructuring agnostic public spaces maintaining network constellations leaving behind repertoires of how to organize social materially when conducting innovative transformations, spellings of the names are Bjorgvinsson,

How design may make new voices audible and present new visibilities, and thus shift the power, arrangement.


### Sub-heading - Post-politics

*Question: Will this section explain that section called Post-politik that delves into the politics. What is the nature of post-politics?*

It goes immediately into describing politics of consensus, emerging from the 19 nineties around state institutions and practices around the power of representative democracy, civil society organizations acting as an integral part of institutional setups, but failing to present a countervailing power to the neoliberal State citizens and civil society organizations are held hostage when they participate in new governance innovation like processes.

These technologies are often advocated and mobilized by NGOs and other civil organizations speaking for the disempowered or socially excluded.

But those NGOs and civil organizations fail to see how these instruments are an integral part of the consolidation consolidation of imposed authoritarian neoliberalism.

Swyngedouw, 2005 to 90 98, or page 99,

Participation is invariably mediated, mediated by power which implies the process of participation, participation.

The processes of participation serve the purpose of cementing the power of elites.

There's 4 propositions of post-politics discussion.

The fourth being the post-politics ultimately undermines critique of capitalism as it operates in symbiosis with the ideology of the bourgeoisie economy. Economic economy is.


### Sub-heading The agent of betrayal: Introducing the dialogue process in Gothenburg 

Introducing the dialogue process in Gothenburg. Here we're getting into some of the Scandinavian context, or more Scandinavian context.

Talks about Gothenburg in 2005, being hit by dock crisis and re-development of a harbour area.

They had a dialogue. 6 month dialogue process, generating visions for the future.

Participatory urban planning or partnership planning.

But the development of the area was failed to be politicized.

The future of the harbour, therefore, was not included.

One person involved describes how radical proposals presented by the team were ignored and implied as a politicization of the process where, like which is ironic, given that it was not actual, actually possible to politicize.

Given the structure.
So there's then some description on how participants in co-design put processes can be imagined as collaborators. and that denotes agency with, in the sense of collaboration.

They then talk about unconditional and tactical collaboration.

Tactical collaboration is where minimal collaboration is actually a cover for purposeful resistance. And then there's a term called quisling.

Do co-design processes betray the interests of their peers.

### Sub-heading - Actor network theory on betrayal

*Question: what is actor network theory and it’s connection to betrayal?*

Point of reference actor network theory is shortened to a ANT.

There's a quote from Latour 2013, around the Garfinkileian heritage which postulates that the concepts of the actors within the actor network theory are allowed to be stronger than those of the analysts. Latour, 2005.

My note here is that the analysts in this circumstance could be the humanitarian and human rights organizations.

Actor network theory precludes an easy delineation between scientific fact and ideological delusion when participating in co-design processes. There's a risk that one's goal.

One's goals are being portrayed or translated away through successive enrolments through the benefactors of this. though the benefactors of this process can never know in advance.

so the betrayal is specifically about the trust that is implicit around actors participating and participatory things participatory design.

You can't guarantee that those things will be made good. Those deals will be made good on and to some extent it goes on to say that it may ultimately cause the researchers to side with the powerful.

It'd be interesting to find out who is the powerful in the humanitarian open source software space technocratic elites will may not always be fully in control of the outcomes of co-design.

There's an interesting section in this as her padding about quasi-objects as protagonists. 

Context of pre existing social divisions among humans that is, masters and slaves. Our argument is more interested in how non human entities contribute to this very sorting operation. In other words, our increase is into the role of quasi objects as protagonists in this story.

### Sub-heading - Translation and betrayal in the Gothenburg dialogue process

*Question: What does the nature of betrayal mean? What is a dialogue process? Who is the agent in this section? Actor network theory on betrayal? Who wasn't? What? Who and what is the actor network? And why is there theoretical betrayal or real betrayal? 
Question: I hope that this gives like a more concrete example of betrayal within context.*

There's a description of a team being in a responsive role that assumes that as a designer you do what you can to leverage the community's assets to effect positive change, but do not seek it. Seek to take it upon yourself to try to do it all for other social actors.

If the process is conceived as a chain of sequential data exchanges, each link is governed by desires, desires of the receiver, implying that the known desire is treated as noise.

So this is describing how information filters through the co-design or participatory design process, and the process of what gets treated as noise or filtered out. possibly through methods of betrayal, possibly through idealistic thinking and non-realistic thinking.

It talks about a filtering method of post it note generation and a consensus orientated designerly method.

One typical rule of this exercise is to actively avoid negative ideas or to criticise the ideas about others.

Creative spaces don't judge, as said by open Ideo and ideo in 2011 negative notes stifle the creative process.

There's an assertion that the designee designer Lee mode of inscription is more about communicating the internal work of the team to outside audiences. That is the wider public and the municipal planning professionals.

Does they then go on to talk about pro catering to the views that are directly applicable in the Development plan.

They should not process political proposals.

### Sub-heading - Analyzing the dialogue process. 

*Question: Why do we need to analyze it? What is it even? Why does it need to be analysed?*

Here it suggests that the dialogue process is one of the most important things. It's come up a few times.
They describe 3 themes immediately specifying what we mean when we speak of a democratic deficiency and methods of persist participation. outline merits of introducing actor network theory and juxtaposing it with a type of critique in the post-politic discussion, and third, expanding on the benefits and perils of the using the term protocol largely. 

The first point is around a concern in how the manner, in the manner in which consensus is reached what is consensus making essentially is it able to not build in betrayal?

Then it goes on to micro power struggles exercised in the co-design process.

Then, lastly, it talks about re-engineering the protocols of collaboration around reimagining design management and facilitating decentralized modes of co design that do not require top down regulation organizations or processes governed by protocols are not necessarily good.

There's, then, some final points on the inevitability of betrayal is both the strength and weakness of design to be disentangled from the political conflicts it tries to address.

But rootless men always betray which is a quote from a sociologist, Robert Nisbet, 1953. So if it sounds like, if participatory design or design is rootless, e.g. Has no rooting in realism, or politics or critique or power, then it will betray. or how can it live with the inevitability of betrayal?

This book, though largely talks about distinct moments in time like almost project-based things. And I'm interested in exploring the notion of consistency because one of my key arguments in the PhD Is that a lot of what's been talked about here is true of open source and building, open source for good or for otherwise or for humanitarian human rights cases who follow this same pattern, but whether, with a notable difference, the open source encourage distinct interventions, distinct interactions, they assume and try to cultivate sustained interactions where it would be less easy for betrayal and more easy for equitable power.

## Next chapter is 4. Corruption 

### Sub-heading - Design, and Decay. 

*Question: Is that the decaying of design or the design then decay of the thing that is involved.*

A short section for this sub-heading.
Mentions of participatory budgeting (PB) and critical policy studies speak to how designs - specifically policy designs deviate from mainstream political models and decay overtime. ‘Original’ designs rarely ‘hold’ given the institutions, technical character and policies evolve.
This chapter moves away from the message of inevitable betrayal of participants interests in co-design and how intentions of organisations can be eroded and betrayed via corruption.
The tension between maintaining the state of things in the context of change.
Machiavelli and the language of innovation.

### Sub-heading - Another world is possible!

*Question: What is not good about our world?*

Hardt & Negri 2003 re. The world social forum “…new forms of participatory democracy together with the utopian schemers of global democracy”
Participatory budgeting stood out

Books about the new millennium and anti-globalization, or alter globalization movement.

Talks references A Hardt and Negri quote. So Hardt And Negri 2003 quote which finishes with a sentence around the globalization protest movements, referencing new forms of participatory democracy and participatory budgeting.

Participatory budgeting is where a process. When community members collectively decide how to allocate part of municipal funds do certain projects deemed urgent by the community, instead of delegating this process to elected politicians or bureaucrats is being used in 3,000 cities worldwide.

It became a go-to policy in the toolbox of the World Bank.

That's the end of this subheading. I haven't answered the question about what not, what is not good about our world.


### Sub-heading - The travels of participatory budgeting. 

*Question: Are we talking about some kind of participatory nature of things. But we're talking about it in terms of financial terms. Maybe budgeting could be about assigning effort.*

Are we talking about some kind of participatory nature of things? But are we talking about it in terms of financial means or maybe budgeting could be about signing effort as well.

This subheading starts with a story from the 1980 S. In Brazil, around democratization and participatory participation in voluntary organizations among the poor.

There's 5 benefit beneficial outcomes of participatory budgeting.

First, You mobilise citizens, particularly the poor the civic sphere. 

Second, the civic sphere is energized.

Third, quality of the infrastructure and services increase.

Fourth, corruption decreases transparency can occur.

Fifth neighborhood level decision making tended to favor the poor and made progressive redistribution of benefits.

Present some description about how PT Lost power in the municipality.
The model was true. Has been tried to be emulated and it ends with participatory budgeting truly challenges the status quo.


### Sub-heading - Resisting corrosive environments. 

*Question: Which environments are corrosive and how they need to be resisted against?*

There's some discussion on whether the failure of participatory budgeting was a design fault, or whether there were different political or sociological things going on that had more or less corrosive effects.

There's some discussion on how to care for experimental designs as they leave the prototype stage and claim a life for their own which is particularly relevant to open source software spaces designer has to prepare for the corrosive effects of a new environment. Especially when it needs to be flexible enough to serve many people or masters as written in the text.

Hacker projects may initially hold a promise of autonomy from either state or capital, but as they progress, they tend to be recuperated by such agencies, which is very true of open source software, especially when it becomes popular or very useful, especially that it needs to be sustained through grant funding of some description.

Recuperation thus operates by replacing the goals and values that were initially professed by a community of hackers, users, citizen science scientists, etc., with new ones, which are better aligned with the needs of capital accumulation and State control.

This is from Soderberg and Maxigas.

These processes are typically resisted by communities. and they generate infighting. Typically, one faction remains attached to the original values and design goals, and another seeks to accommodate that design. The how toes to external pressures.

So it seems like the environments that are corrosive are the systems of control as kind of described in this subheading or at the very least corrosive to the participatory nature of the design.

### Sub-heading - Against disruption: Mantenere Io Stato. 

*Question: Will the chapter explain.*

The disruption might be a reference to technology disruption. Curious to know if that is case.
This section goes into more Machiavelli theory.

Papanek talking about, or references to Papanek triangle around designers trained to focus on desired ends and preferred situations, may lose sight of all the undesired outcomes that their programs and courses of action may generate.

While design interventions must always strive for a better world. Designers must equally be careful not to recklessly leave the world in a worse situation than we found it.

Innovation, according to Machiavelli, serves to stabilize, not revolutionize.
In contrast to modern theorists, the world is too stable and needs innovation to change even revolutionize it. Machiavelli talks about disruptive innovation.

Discussion on the failure of participatory budgeting.
Alternate designs are necessary, but not sufficient, as the corrosive effects of the political environment cause designs to decay.

### Sub-heading - Micro finance, the quintessential social innovation.

*Question: I want an example about micro finance.*

Like participatory budgeting, there is a section on micro-finance specifically and then a story about the practice from the 1980s to the 1990s And the origin story in 1976, Bangladesh around a micro-lending program and a bank for the poor and how these practices deployed in lower income countries it mitigates, apparently mitigates the exclusion of poor individuals from the flows of credit enabling them to become self sufficient.

It's popular because of social innovation that emerged in the 2000s.

The 2010s Microfinance became the go to example that policy makers use when introducing, introducing the notion of social innovation.

Social ends, on the other hand, implies that social innovation produces socially beneficial outcomes innovations that are socially in both their ends and their means. Social in their ends, in their means.

The deployment of such design processes does not necessarily produce socially beneficial outcomes.

Indeed, the leveraging of the social mail will produce unforeseen negative societal outcomes.

Within micro-finance there is a false promise or there could be a false promise. There's no example and then it states that other sections go in to talk about design in relation to social innovation.

### Sub-heading - Social innovation in design. 

*Question: I hope that it is clearly about socialization. And does that social innovation and design?*

States and assert some imperatives of social values in design and ethical quality of endeavours of design, designs being socially oriented.

Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby writers from 2013 state that social to design may focus too much on fixing things.

The UN Office in New York suggests that design practices are increasingly deemed relevant for the humanitarian agenda (Cf. Smith 2007) and similarly, book titles like 'design like you give a damn' by the 'architecture for humanity' and 'design revolution', '100 products that empower people' pillow. Tom 2009 shows that design is no longer primarily concerned with glossy commodities.

Theres then, some discussion about Ezio Manzini, social design primarily addresses particularly problematic social situations, often through a charity framework in situations to which both the market and the State failed to find solutions.

Social innovation on the other hand, aims to produce solutions based on new social forms and economic models.

I've got a note here as to what if either of these or any of these does open source software fall into?

There are some terms: Jugaad Innovation and frugal innovation.

This perspective on hacking is not least exemplified in the random acts, hacks of kindness, initiative, where corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, collaborated in the United Nations to organize events structured as hackathons.

Such events involve designers and programmers working on solutions for disaster, management and crisis response, engaging in UN secretary, general BanKi Moon as a keynote speaker. (Walker 2010)

Then some discussion about social capital.
Social, entrepreneurial endeavour builds upon social capital as well as enhances it.

Social capital and community are used in the same sentence and we begin to discover or investigate the term trust, and it obfuscating the potential corruption.

There is an insight that there is a dark side of the social, and it tends to be neglected in the literature, on social innovation and design and naive understandings of the term community as in participatory projects, are often written by a naive understanding of the term community around, not regarding the internal dynamics and differences of stakeholders our own biases, gender issues, and other inequalities.

### Sub-heading - Anti-social innovation. 

*Question: I want an explanation of that.*

Here we have the first mention in a header of innovation, actually, which is one of my PhD key words.
By cutting into the social capital the local traditions and interpersonal trust. Microfinance may stretch social commitments undermining the very communities that they are supposed to support. Thus the leveraging of social process produces antisocial effects.

There's a problem that emerges from leveraging social capital as a substitute for collateral when financial means and real assets are scarce. This is very specifically related to open source software, open source software leverages, social capital as a substitute for collateral without finance.

Humanitarian and human rights organizations also do that to some extent around volunteer work and then it leaves the deficit.

There's then some talk about social pressure from group members creating joint liability among the poor group. 

Accountability and agenda related aspect to this issue around how women play a crucial but not necessarily deserving role in the leveraging of social collateral.

Specifically this example around microcredits and social financing is intertwined with the patriarchy. As a writer, Rachman States 90, 99, page 51.
It plays on the pride of individuals, social esteem and the social esteem of groups in developing economies and social groups and makes them highly trustworthy. Trustful of the scheme. The social innovation scheme.

There's a risk of the fear of public embarrassment.

### Sub-heading - Anti-political innovation.

*Question: How, if at all, does this relate back to the ‘politik’*

There's some definitions and delineations between the political and the anti-political.

The phenomenon is political, if it renders a problem or object open to contestation and dissensus.

Conversely, an actor or phenomenon is anti-political, if it closes down the space for contestation.

There's an example from participatory budgeting around policy design opening space for new ways of governing. But the space was gradually closed down as participatory budgeting was neutralized and placed within the World Bank toolbox.

Anti-political effects have been discussed in the context of participative design by Cooke and Kothari 2001 point to the problems that arise from the idea that if the designer can just improve the participative nature of design practices. Such practices will get better. Inform the basis for best practice.

However, Cooke and Kothari suggest that there is a tyrannical potential in this tendency as the focus on how the practitioner operates or on the specificities of the techniques and tools employed, embodies the potential for unjustified exercise of power.

This is kind of where we get into trust and social. It relates back to in the previous heading what was being said about social embarrassment and that kind of thing

Cooke and Kothari suggest that designer practitioners of participatory methods need to ask themselves some important questions. Do participatory facilitators override existing legitimate decision making processes. Do group dynamics lead to participatory decisions that reinforce the interests of the already powerful and have participatory methods driven out others which have advantages, participation cannot provide.

### Sub-heading - Anti-inventive innovation. 

Everything's anti something innovation or something anti something.
Certain technology may be anti-inventive if it displaces or blocks off other potentially technical or otherwise possibilities.

Microfinance can be said to have blocked the emergence of alternative economic practices, such as and the outcomes of my query, finance, innovations were encountered to the promise of innovation itself.

Has Western innovation, design techniques blocked emergence of alternate practices is my note around design practice.

Social innovations may produce anti-social effects, corroding social capital generating frictions, anti political outcomes, displace debates on political alternatives and anti-inventive outcomes, suspend the development of alternative modes of economic life.

Innovations are by their very nature unpredictable and original intentions and objectives may well become displaced as they meet the corrosive effects of the sociopolitical environment.

How can designers maintain the integrity of their designs.

### Sub-heading - Virtu and values in social design. 

*Question: I want this to talk about the decay, but also talk about the restorative.*

We've moved away from like the anti into the virtues and values.
Preparing for cruel twists of fate.

There are no detailed lists of the characters of virtue.

It this section largely talks about Machiavelli's position, representing a challenge to the design discipline around the current debates on values in design. If they focus on if they still vote, focus on intentions.

Value sensitive design, which is Friedman and Henry 2019, which is how to devise prescriptive design methods which moderate the values of participants, whilst also actively instilling human values into a design process.

There is, then, a question towards the end, which is. How to position the role of the designer? Is the designer just another person? Or should the designer be understood as more so as understood more as a sovereign.

Designers often see themselves as the former, being just another person the side of the people, but that design has come to play an instrumental, instrumental part of statecraft.

I've got some notes here at the end of the chapter which read, innovation cannot be renamed social design or social design cannot be renamed or removed.
Innovation or social design cannot be removed from the sociopolitical environment which, depending on those circumstances, may skew the goodness of the social innovation. Thus social innovation or social design requires knowledge of the complex sociopolitical within its processes. Design process alone cannot facilitate the sociopolitical out of social innovation or social design. No governance can mediate that.

How does the open source software operate in its sociopolitical space? Is the development aware of this, or unaware of this? And what are the what if the beneficiaries or the people, that the designers are just another person of what are the inherent, or, to use a kind of gross word, native practices that are used within that specific social innovation space.

Or that's that social space, or that sociopolitical space, or like community, or those people. How aware of that are they? Do they need to continue to be aware of that?
How can designers participate as a person outside of statecraft?

## Next chapter is 5. Cunning 

### Sub-heading - Metis and designerly state craft. 

*Question: Will this heading explain?
Question: How nation States. Operate in design, or have influence, design.*

Metis. Not sure what Metis is or design early statecraft.
Design has a kind of capacity that was desperately needed in healthcare and education, and rethinking systems and governments were the owners of these problems.

So we felt like these 2 communities needed to meet each other. Valtonen 2020, page 522.

Talking about the Helsinki design lab exit a Helsinki design lab existed exclusively to introduce strategic design in government for as long as design is something that is done to governments. It is not going to fundamentally change government design needs to be in government to change it.

I imagine that this can also apply to humanitarian organizations human rights organizations and also open source software to some extent. And also what is the interplay of those things?

If you have design in humanitarian human rights organizations as a, in this case, a proxy to government.

How, and then also design in open source, so they need to be one in the same to, in order to fundamentally change both the humanitarian human rights and the case cases, the products, the tools, whatever, and also the open source.

There's some discussion in how designers think of themselves as situated on the side of the people, whereas from the perspective of the people, they are likely viewed as part of the power structures, the institutions, the organizations, the government, etc.


### Sub-heading - Empathy as a trap is the.

*Question: Why is empathy a trap? Can it not be a trap?*

The first part describes a project meeting in Stockholm representing a political party. The Green party.

A two-year inquiry, was essentially two-year exercise in how to get to politicians, to not speak politically about fundamentally political issues.

Therefore avoid referencing political reality.

There is a proposition that design early practices may rejuvenate, rejuvenate public services.

Ideo founder, Tim Brown suggested that design thinking may rejuvenate the infrastructure of democratic capitalism. 

In 2014 Brian Martin and Berger, Martin states the hidden secret of Ideo is sophisticated intervention. Design service design was put forward as by the Swedish Swedish Association for local authorities and regions.

Educational videos and other materials as part of an innovation guide for local authorities.

The audience being civil servants working within innovation units in local government.

Citizens with universal rights are then recast as users whose needs become subject to negotiation, orchestrated by service design, governmental complex.

Many designers inclusive of ideo underplay the political negotiation struggles and established rights.

The proposition, empathy is trap is a nod to Foucault, around visibility is a trap around the Panopticus is Panopticus is panopticism.

The comparison between empathizing and being empathized with it implies a mode of observation and surveillance.
But also a laboratory which engenders new forms of knowledge, designerly, modes of entrapment.

### Sub-heading - Another footnote to Plato.

*Question: Why, Plato?*

Proposition, that design has always been a matter of laying traps. The act of designing has always been a devious enterprise.

We tend not to recognize that. There's a dissertation from 2014 by Benedict Singleton on craft and being crafty.

This begins to get into Metis, which becomes important later on in the book, and talked about a lot. Metis is Greek term.

Greeks had philosophical vocabulary of the ancient Greeks, between

Poiesis, which is making, and Techne, which is art or skill. But then there's also a third term Metis, meaning a kind of cunning intelligence used for laying traps.

Metis, apparently, is the term that best captures the essence of design via Singleton, Benedict Singleton.

There's then, a sentence about design and deception

Design can be understood as a scheme, a plot, a concoction, or a simulation. Indeed, as a kind of deception. The empathy may be real, the relationship between designer and user sympathetic. But the trap is still laid. It is the bait bringing designers and users together, luring them into shifting the scale from rights to effects bypassing political contestation.

It seeks to work with and coax the coax effects from the material or environment.
It is amoral, neither inherently good nor evil.


### Sub-heading - The art of the strong

*Question: I’m curious to know whether that is a specific use of the word art.*

I think that might be the first mention of the word art in relation to design, which is interesting.
Metis and tactics are collapsed into an art. Art corrodes power. It is a mode of action emerging from below in order to determine users true needs, personal cognitive space has to be charted. 

Empathy is a trap because it constitutes the tactic for probing the desires and propensities of private and individuals.

Proximity, power plays in proximity, power plays disappear in the fog of war.


### Sub-heading - The one in the warmth of empathy.

*Question: I want that to clearly describe what warmth of empathy is why it's important*

Stories about a few different urban innovation, social design projects specifically about a Sauna in Gothenburg.

Around public baths being gatherings, social gathering spaces but also discussion for politics, business deals and other things like hedonism, crime etc.

The design brief implied that the Sauna would be temporary and demolished but it was very popular.

It was not on long term maps, but it was accepted as a permanent structure because of how popular it was by the people.

It also talks about cleaning up or 'civilising' areas so largely about gentrification.

### Sub-heading - Neuro liberal experiments

*Question: of what are those liberal experiments.*

Design informed, inspire experiments in public governance has been dubbed. The new spirit of policy making design is not only deployed as a practical means to improve and streamline welfare vision just come to inform the very modest operandi about which States govern And it's neural. 

Liberal modes of governing design of the experiment would first concentrate on building empathy and broad understanding of the problem by using qualitative methods and design, thinking the later phases would emphasize measurability of its impact through the thorough evaluation of its results.

This is about design for government operating models, I believe, in Finland.

Around the design for government, human centric governance. 2015 results from the experiment were inconclusive at least around unemployment outcomes.

### Sub-heading - Cunning uses of feedback

*Question: Here, I want to understand why cunning has been used. Is it duplicitous in its nature?*

States that there is a clear connection between emerging neoliberalism and cybernetics missing Link being the field of design.

There's then a description of 1950’s Design education at the own School of Design, which appears to be based in Germany.

Then some large detail about Cyberneticist societies.

Contemporary discourse on designing government tends to use a rhetoric that seems close to the John Dewey Democratic experimentalism or Lipman's guided democracy user citizens invariably play a secondary role with their inputs being elicited by the iterative interventions of the designer.

The chaos of diverging views among the citizens had to be organized in order for democracy to work a new task of organizing this chaos.

There is a connection between design and political power here.

Our designers, the quintessential technocrats of the 20 first century designers need to revise their views on their place in relation to centres of power.

Note
At the end of the chapter is a note It details a quote by Bruno Menari. printed on the walls of the Design Museum in London. Progress means simplifying, not complicating. simplify the messy reality to citizens. One may imagine design thinkers as professionals that simplify the world for its users.


## Next chapter is 6. Hypocrisy

### Sub-heading - of virtue and vice.

*Question: In what ways is it brittle*

I think there's an assumption or insinuation there that design is hypocritical.
There's a question towards the end of the first page, which is, how does one nurture skepticism and still carry on designing design? One may be best served by accepting a disconnect between the actions of the professional designer, on the one hand, and the personal beliefs of the person behind the professional mask on the other.

Designers should not be worried about maintaining such a disconnect. They ought to worry about the risks of being too cavalier about the realities of Design. Power intentions can be detected in the shift from 'design for' to 'design with' around citizens and users, and the emphasis on designerly empathy.

### Sub-heading - With? Not for citizens? The stakes of designerly virtues.

*Question: I expect this is going into detail about what designers describe as virtuous in their processes.*

It first talks about the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum, New Design Museum in New York, launching their design for the other 90% underlined co-design and participatory elements of urban design.

This talks largely about the global north and the systems of most designers are in the global global north and are taken for, taken for granted who is really served by design, and who has, a say a move towards empathy as the primary quality and operational methodology of design.

Not only is empathy a key virtue, it is also the ambition to act as an agent of change, referencing Tim Brown's 2,009 book change by design which assumes that the world is just an incomplete, chaotic arrangement of interest, eagerly waiting for a designer to come and reorder it in an innovative way.

This assumes that design changes things and it makes things better. And the whatever came previously was bad design. Bad outcomes can always be fixed by new iterations and new additions and change means good design, and it's never corrupt.

There's then some talk about the technocratic movement of the 19 twenties and thirties.

Designing with is a means to engage with the question of social relations and design is, after all, a service profession. There's some text here about the designer is no longer a helpful dictator, an all-powerful social engineer, the designer should strive to be your friend.

The proximity to the user complex creates a complex situation. The designer patterns with the user, even though he or she or like, is paid by a client to manipulate the user. I think this might be one of the critical key parts, for manipulation starts to be talked about.

If designers acknowledge any political problems in design, it's usually found in the methods, not in the very ontology of design itself.

Such connotations can be shunted by a more open approach. So this is the first time that openness and open design specifically even open design. In the next sentence has been mentioned, and it doesn't get mentioned again.

### Sub-heading - Ideal idealism for the real world?

The idealistic natures of design may be described here

The imperative of the designer as an activist and change maker dominant mode of designerly engagement with the sociopolitical realm.

There's some talk about the book design for the real world. A bit more re investigation into realism and idealism.

And then a lot of talking about how design is used in war.


### Sub-heading - The ordinary vices of design. 

I'm assuming that this will detail the ordinary traps that design falls into.
This is talking about lessons that can be learned from a political text about Liberal Politics, by Shklar.

Judith Shklar's Ordinary vices from 1984, which is something about understanding. When cruelty is put first and vices are discussed.

The hypocrite, is someone who pretends his moat, his motives and intentions and character is irreproachable when he knows that they are blame. Where are they when it comes to doing the sordid business of design? The key issue is that of duplicity that emerges from the concealment of one's personal beliefs.

So does this suggest that you can't do good design unless your political beliefs are like for lack of a better term cure. If you don't have personal beliefs, or maybe it's about agnosticism. Or maybe neither of those things. Maybe it's just about understanding that you will. There will be duplicitousness in your the existence designer who recognizes the sordid nature of design and still goes on doing must be a hypocrite.

They then go on to talk about urban planning, and Robert Moses in the next chapter.

### Sub-heading - Moses, the misanthrope

*Question: Why is it useful?*

Moses is a planner, an urban planner in New York City.

Do artefacts have politics around the politics of design?

If the bridges were too low. It meant that the Jones Beach development could not be reached by public transport, and there, therefore, excluding racial minorities.

There is then Bernwald and Joerges talking about Langdon Winner.

where the design version of artifacts have artifacts, have politics in which a designer wills a so specific social state, and then suitably transfers this intention into an artifact, thus forming an enduring social relationship that is built into the artifact.

It's around techno-determinism.

There's then some notes about paranoia over-emphasis and personal convictions and intentions and critique who is the hypocrite.

### Sub-heading - Sincerity and professionalism?

*Question: I'm curious about what what words are used and how they're defined. It seems to be very clearly defining.* 

Sincerity? A virtue? In what way is it not a virtue. Professionalism also. In what way is that? A virtue slash, not a virtue or duplicitous?

This is talking about the sincerity of the designer's intentions, public mask, and the personal convictions of a designer.

I've made a note around who is not flawed.

There's then an important section. After talking about the Iraq War and Tony Blair around design in politics and politic political failures and design early fiascos.

Unfortunately, one of the fields of design where this is most common is the context of development work, as in humanitarian and international development work, where designers keep reproducing disasters through well meaning designs, echoing betrayal, enhancing corruption and cunning post. Colonial relations of dependency in the name of progress the design. Literature is full of well meaning energy systems, playground pumps, water carriers, vehicles, and crafts that boost project fatigue and end up in landfills, even though the designers had the purest intentions, but failed. Execution of their agency and their power.

### Sub-heading - How to be a better kind of hypocrite. 

*Question: If you can acknowledge the hypocrisy. Can you make it into a virtue?*

So there's some text about treading carefully and not and avoiding lumping all hypocrisies together which ones are and are not worth worrying about, which is Runciman 2008.

Talks a bit about personas. People wearing masks.

We need them to be sincere about the system of which they find themselves, which is a Runciman, 2008 Comment

The design profession does not have to bear such considerations in mind. Still second order. Hypocrisy does not, does constitute a problem in design. We need designers who are sincere about the systems of power, and which they may find themselves being sincere about power structures also entails, recognizing some of the problems.

Even though empathy and participation are worthy foundations. Such virtue should not distract our view from the fact that design does not necessarily empower the disempowered.

### Sub-heading - Dare to be naive, redux

*Question: What purpose does naivety serve?*

This, is effectively a summary of the chapter talks largely about misanthropy and Machiavelli.

We must learn from Machiavelli, yet avoid becoming all out Machiavellians rather than fostering a disappointed idealist sensibility. We must find a nuanced and pragmatic position.


## Next chapter is 7. Closing propositions 

### Sub-heading - After empathy, Realdesign 

Real design sense seems to be their term for a new kind of design. That they're laying out. 

This first section introduces the concept concept of real design, all, in word the real prospective, real design is not meant to celebrate the Machiavellian, or authoritarian or or turrets to defend and develop the democratic elements and participatory processes, or co-design
what basic relations of social power undermine the visions of designers set out with and come to shape the co-design process.

### Sub-heading - Proposition 1: One design must get real. 

*Question: What does real mean? what is real in the grand scheme of things? What is real? How would we even know?*

The basic political question has to be an extension of Lenin's realist. Who whom to become? Who does? What? To whom? For whose benefit?
And then there's about the threat of that for realist designers.

### Sub-heading - Proposition 2: to the process of change is a process of conflict. 

*Question: What kind of conflict? Who's conflict? What kind of change. Who's change?*

Talks about Utopia. Dystopia and change. Visioning is not a neutral process.
Do not shy away from the power that comes with the profession of design. Do not hide your responsibility. The designers, responsibilities behind users or participants, or toothless principles who is being used when you describe people as users.

### Sub-heading - Proposition 3: There is something rotten design in the user is the victim. 

*Question: What is rotten in design?*)
*Question: Why is the user, the victim? And why? Who? Who and how has have they been placed there?*

The designer needs to engage in if they are engaging in social processes needs to practice power, literacy and design.

Do not fool fool yourself users or hostages. They are held by designers as human shields.

Effective social design work must not be mistaken for good hearted volunteerism failing to push the bigger issue, and Solutionism. Shying away from how users are continuously abused betrays the people they are saying they support, recognizes the unavoidable conflicts users are stuck in. It must be the starting point for the engagement and my question here, written in the margins is, what, in what ways do statements of knowledge help? And do they.

### Sub-heading - Proposition 4: Good is dead

*Question: How and why is good dead?*

Well, empathy does strive to connect with others still self referential. The foundation of the connection emerges from my own feelings and experiences and therefore I normally connect with those who are in my in group.

I've got a note here, but not these different to me/us. Disagreement in social design.

Voices of users that read on the read off of the readable emotional spectrum.

What is open source? Software is political agenda.

Why make humanitarian or human rights open source? So far as a question that I've written in the margins empathetic, empathetic?

Is it only that which translates to operational guidelines and can increase the power and status of those inside the organizations.

Empathy is not enough actually representing the user's interests in the final design is real design, decolonial. A question I wrote in the margins.

The quest for good needs to be backed by a realistic perspective on power.

### Sub-heading - Proposition 5: Realdesign creative form of realism.

Some text, mostly about imagination, creative power, realism.

Realists operate vibrant forms of imaginative storytelling for designers. Valuable constructive critique can open and reconfigure the issue and make for better future decisions. But the real designer must know the limits of the framework used to judge things as constructive.

### Sub-heading - Proposition 6: Ask realist questions

*Question: What does it mean to ask realist questions?*

Realism has put the focus on the attainment of concrete ends and mobilizing enough social momentum to make an ideal idea, real.

And what chasms of power open. There's then a series of billet points which I've heavily highlighted. I'll read them out.

Who is the user or stakeholder? What is in their interest?

Who is the client? What is in their interest? Who do you report to what is in their interest, who is invited or included, and who is excluded in present and historical context. What are the structural and institutional frameworks around this action? How is agency and power redistributed? Who is offer power? Who is it withdrawn from? How is the social relations of loyalty and commitments redistributed or reformed?

Who earns? What in the end how can reimbursement compensation for the weakest be guaranteed? Or how must they mobilise to enhance their leverage?

I think I'll add these questions to my ecosystem mapping section.

I then made some notes about distributed and controlled through dissemination of agency control checks and balances. I question about whether open source software can follow these processes or have these processes already and also whether human, humanitarian human rights opens or software itself, have political perspectives or methods or have power.
