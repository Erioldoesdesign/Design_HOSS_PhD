# Review of 'Open Source, Open Science, and the Replication Crisis in HCI'

This paper covers a number of different ideas and thoughts around HCI, research (in HCI), Openness and Replication and speaks to a number of complexities 
around the combination of HCI and 'Open Source'.

There is a theme about why HCI researchers in particular do not or will not open up their research and the reaction or perceived response from the 
open source community being that of 'No code, no good and not open source'.

There is a thread about the inherent 'maturity' of HCI within an openness context and whether it is classed (yet) as a 'science' discipline 
and therefore 'welcomed(?)' into the space of openness/OSS.

There is then some brief discussion on the practices of the HCI community within the conext of OSS community practices referencing the there is a 
lack of extrinsic/social reasoning for HCI to open source there work and may also imply that there is a different or resistent social structure within HCI. 
This ties into a further throught about usefulness of OSS in terms of HCI research that has been opened and that if it is not forked/used then it is not 
useful and you could imply 'obselete'.

There appears to be a missing element within the paper which is understandble impact of 'business' and the thriving of 'business' in terms of OSS when HCI is involved.
When reading through the counter arguements there is a sectionw hich speaks to 'opening' up the HCI ethnographic artifacts and the practicioner in myself responded
with a question that speaks to a large aspect of the commodification and value of 'design' and 'HCI' as 'sellable' artifacts and the 'secrets' of design that, when
opened up, become 'less valuable' or the nervousness around the percieved value of a closed artifact and the designers 'understanding' of that artifact within the context
of the problem they are solving with design becomes complicated, de-commodified and perhaps then, 'worthless'. Perhaps even then even able to be transformed into
an 'algorithm' for design knowledge.

### Questions

Is a key problem about the community cultural structures of OSS in relation to design and HCI? 
How does academic understanding of HCI/Design counter to practice based involvement in OSS projects?
If a HCI OSS project is never forked is it not 'useful?' what code-based OSS can be used as an example here (if at all?)


### Quotes
"In this paper, we look at the extent by which the replication
crisis affects a field like HCI that also involves a significant
number of software artifacts. Of course, this is also related
to the larger question of whether HCI itself can be classified as a "science", a "discipline" or something else entirely"

"As HCI is centered on computing artifacts, a particularly
interesting subset of this topic is the relation between opensource software/hardware and HCI research: how is it
used, and how is it contributed to? How are efforts at replication hindered by lack of source code and data? How can
the open-source model help with current questions about
the publishing process?"

"Although there may be a wide range of reasons for this lack
of releases (e.g. anxiety that one’s own code is "not good
enough" for the public [2], not wanting to provide future support for the software, social barriers when contributing to
an existing project [19]), the most likely reason is that this
practice is not encouraged by the community. Packaging a
research project’s codebase for release will undeniably create extra work for the authors, and this work is currently not
rewarded. While individual, widely known research software
packages such as R have many volunteer contributions, the
motivations for these contributions are complex and often
not long-term, as analyzed by Mair et al.

"HCI, as a discipline, sometimes seems to be determined to
"reinvent the wheel" time and again instead of building on
existing work (also called "not-invented-here syndrome").
This may be part of a broader issue within HCI as identified by Marshall et al. [13]: citations to prior work are often
also not reflected upon critically, and the content of the prior
publication is not engaged with. Consequently, even if researchers do the extra work of releasing their projects as
open source, they are unlikely to be reused by other researchers and quickly become forgotten."

"As Ye and Kishida [26] as well as von Krogh et
al. [21] have found, a successful open-source community
requires both intrinsic (learning) and extrinsic (social) motivation for participants. If the extrinsic/social aspect is underrepresented (as it is currently the case in HCI), it is unlikely
that such a community will thrive or even form in the first
place."

"I don’t have time to create an open-source project from my
research."
We believe that even a five-minute open-source release
which solely consists of a project snapshot and a license
file is better than none at all. In addition, this is likely due
to the aforementioned "chicken-and-egg" problem. If the
community would value these contributions as equal to a
published paper - or better yet, as integral part of the publication - researchers would not consider the time spent
preparing such a contribution as wasted"

""A focus on open source disregards HCI contributions which
do not create source code."
As mentioned above, we acknowledge that there is a wide
spectrum of possible research contributions in the HCI
space which do not necessarily involve writing source code.
However, within the context of this paper, we use the term
"open source" more loosely to refer to the "open source philosophy" of releasing one’s tools in general, which we consider applicable to any research contribution - e.g. authors
of an ethnographic study should also make their questionnaires, coding schemes, and other artifacts such as spreadsheets or statistical analysis scripts available to the public."

"In order to thrive
as a discipline, HCI will have to adopt a more open stance."
