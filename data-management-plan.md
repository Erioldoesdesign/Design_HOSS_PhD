## 1. Description of the data

### 1.1 Type of study 
_Up to three lines of text that summarise the type of study (or studies) for which the data are being collected._

This research will involve conducting semi-structured contextual interviews where written (digital) notes, audio transcription, video and audio recording will be collected. Written information will also be captured in a virtual whiteboard (Miro) by both the researcher and the interview participant. Future types of studies include: Diary studies where participants write their own data in a format comfortable for them, shadowing and observation by the researcher will be captured in written and audio/video formats. Fieldwork will include participatory information collected from participants along with public online contributions to open repositories along with auto-ethnographic processes by the researcher.


### 1.2 Assessment of existing data 
_An explanation of the existing data sources that will be used by the research project, with references. Or an analysis of the gaps identified between the currently available and required data for the research._

- Literature reviews written on an open repository hosted on GitHub under the [Creative Commons Legal Code Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/legalcode)
- Relevant quantative data and qualatative data from literature reviews may be referenced throughout the PhD.
- Data sources offered by participant organisations.
- Relevant contextual open data sets e.g. [Humanitarian Data Exchange's humanitarian data](https://data.humdata.org/)


### 1.3	Types of data
_Types of research data to be managed in the following terms: quantitative, qualitative; generated from surveys, interviews, observations etc. Include the use of any code or software if it aids the creation or processing of the data._

- Quantitative
- Qualitative
- Interviews
- Observations
- Auto-ethnographic
- [HDX data](https://data.humdata.org/dataset)
- [HXL Standard](https://hxlstandard.org/)
- Open Git Repositories from participants (TBC)


### 1.4	Format and scale of the data
_File formats, software used, number of records, databases, (in terms that are meaningful in your field of research). Do formats and software enable sharing and long-term validity of data? How large is the data going to be?_

- Markdown .md
- Text Documents .docx .pdf and .ott
- Spreadsheet data .sdc .csv
- Sublime text 2, 
- Libre office & iWork suite
- Adobe PDF
- Miro
- GitHub browser & GitHub desktop
- Pen and Paper

Size of the Data does not expect to exceed 30GB. Formats will be defaulted to 'open' formats where applicable.


## 2. Data collection / generation
_Focus on the good practice and standards for ensuring new data are of high quality and processing is well documented._

### 2.1	Methodologies for data collection / generation
_How the data will be collected/generated._ 



### 2.2	Data quality and standards
_How consistency and quality of data collection / generation will be controlled and documented, through processes of calibration, repeat samples or measurements, standardised data capture or recording, data entry validation, peer review of data or representation with controlled vocabularies._




## 3. Data management, documentation and curation


### 3.1	Managing, storing and curating data. 
_Briefly describe how data will be stored, backed-up, managed and curated in the short to medium term (https://www.ncl.ac.uk/library/academics-and-researchers/research/rdm/working/)_

### 3.2	Metadata standards and data documentation
_What metadata is produced about the data generated from the research? For example descriptions of data that enable research data to be used by others outside of your own team. This may include documenting the methods used to generate the data, analytical and procedural information, capturing instrument metadata alongside data, documenting provenance of data and their coding, detailed descriptions for variables, records, etc (see: www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards  / http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/document)_



## 4. Data security and confidentiality of potentially disclosive information
_This section should be completed if your research data includes personal data relating to human participants in research. For other research, the safeguarding and security of data should also be considered. Information provided will be in line with your ethical review. Please note this section concerns protecting the data._

### 4.1	Main risks to data security
_All personal data has an element of risk. Summarise the main risks to the confidentiality and security of information related to human participants, the level of risk and how these risks will be managed. Cover the main processes or facilities for storage and processing of personal data, data access, with controls put in place and any auditing of user compliance with consent and security conditions. (https://www.ncl.ac.uk/research/researchgovernance/ethics/gdpr/)_ 




## 5. Data sharing and access
_Identify any data repository(-ies) that are, or will be, entrusted with archiving, curating and/or sharing data from your study, where they exist for particular disciplinary domains or data types. [Information on repositories is available here](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/library/academics-and-researchers/research/rdm/sharing/)._ 

### 5.1	Suitability for sharing
_Is the data you propose to collect (or existing data you propose to use) in the study suitable for sharing?  If yes, briefly state why it is suitable.
If No, indicate why the data will not be suitable for sharing and then go to 5.3._

### 5.2	Discovery by potential users of the research data
_Indicate how potential new users (outside of your organisation) can find out about your data and identify whether it could be suitable for their research purposes, e.g. through archiving into a research data repository. Will the repository create a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI) to be included in research outputs, including publications?_

### 5.3	Data preservation strategy and standards
_How long will the data be archived and shared for? Will any data be preserved but not shared? If yes, what is the plan for this long-term archiving?_


### 5.4	Restrictions or delays to sharing, with planned actions to limit such restrictions 
_Restriction to data sharing may be due to participant confidentiality, consent agreements or IPR. Strategies to limit restrictions may include data being anonymised or aggregated; gaining participant consent for data sharing; gaining copyright permissions. For prospective studies, consent procedures should include provision for data sharing to maximise the value of the data for wider research use, while providing adequate safeguards for participants. As part of the consent process, proposed procedures for data sharing should be set out clearly and current and potential future risks associated with this explained to research participants._


## 6.	Responsibilities and Resources
_Are there any resources (e.g. storage/ training) that you will require to fulfil the plan?_


## 7. Relevant institutional, departmental or study policies on data sharing and data security
