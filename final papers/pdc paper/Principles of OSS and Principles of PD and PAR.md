8 Principles for Managing a Commons


1. Define clear group boundaries.


2. Match rules governing use of common goods to local needs and conditions.


3. Ensure that those affected by the rules can participate in modifying the rules.


4. Make sure the rule-making rights of community members are respected by outside authorities.


5. Develop a system, carried out by community members, for monitoring members’ behavior.


6. Use graduated sanctions for rule violators.


7. Provide accessible, low-cost means for dispute resolution.


8. Build responsibility for governing the common resource in nested tiers from the lowest level up to the entire interconnected system.
—

1.  As a commoner I clearly understand for which resources I need to care for and with whom I share this responsibility. Commons resources are those that we create together, that we maintain as gifts of nature or whose use has been guaranteed to everyone.

2. We use the commons resources that we create, care for and maintain. We use the means (time, space, technology, and the quantity of a resource) that are available in a given context. As commoner I am satisfied that there is a fair relationship between my contributions and the benefits I receive.

3. We enter into or modify our own rules and commitments, and every commoner can participate in this process. Our commitments serve to create, maintain, and preserve the commons to satisfy our needs.

4. We monitor the respect of these commitments ourselves and sometimes we mandate others whom we trust to help reach this goal. We continually reassess whether our commitments still serve their purpose.

5. We work out appropriate rules for dealing with violations of our commitments. We determine whether and what kinds of sanctions shall be used, depending on the context and severity of a violation.

6. Every commoner can make use of a space and means for conflict resolution. We seek to resolve conflicts among us in an easily accessible and straightforward way.

7. We regulate our own affairs, and external authorities respect that.

8. We realize that every commons is part of a larger whole. Therefore, different institutions working at different scales are needed to coordinate stewardship and to cooperate with each other.

The Open Source Definition
Introduction
Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the following criteria:

1. Free Redistribution
The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.

2. Source Code
The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.

3. Derived Works
The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.

4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code
The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.

5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

7. Distribution of License
The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.

8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.

9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software
The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.

10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral
No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.



### Clearly Defined Boundaries

We clearly articulate the purpose of our project (i.e. our vision, mission, and scope) as well as our values and principles (i.e. the good we manifest in the world, and the way we do our work). We are guided by our purpose and principles in all that we do.

### Appropriate Rules
We make agreements that establish fair relationships among contributors, users, our products, and the project itself. We assign licenses that align with our purpose and values. We set clear expectations for contributors regarding the nature of their contributions. 

### Rule-making processes 
We make it clear who can participate in what kind of decision-making, under which circumstances. Our decision-making processes are transparent, and account for the diverse perspectives of our community. 

### Monitoring
We monitor our adherence to our principles, values, and purpose. We engage in regular testing — of code as well as our assumptions. We share information about the status of our work with the community, and we are committed to improvement when we find it to be needed.

### Sanctions 
When people act in ways that are out of line with our project’s stated principles and purpose, we use a range of methods to encourage re-alignment — from gentle admonishment up to removal from the community of those who can’t or won’t abide by our stated expectations.

### Conflict resolution
We are committed to fair resolution of disagreements when they arise. The ability to resolve disagreements is distributed and accessible, so that all participants feel like they can participate in the process of resolving conflicts that they are a part of.

### Self-governance
Our projects have autonomy to organize ourselves. We make decisions about how we structure our work and our communities as it is appropriate to our projects’ principles, values, and purpose.

### Nestedness/Subsidiarity/Polycentricity
We embrace the complexity of our projects, which involve multiple parties and various scales, and so we engage in decision-making at various scales with various parties. Modules exist within broader projects, which might exist within organizations, which might use one or more platforms, which themselves exist within technological ecosystems, such as the broader free/libre open source software community, and so on. Our governance systems coordinate and cooperate across these levels, and we assume that whenever feasible and appropriate, decisions should be made by people who are ‘closest’ to the matter at hand.
