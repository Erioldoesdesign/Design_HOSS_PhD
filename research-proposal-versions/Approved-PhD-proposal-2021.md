## Aims
The purpose of this research is to critically explore how human centred design is currently practiced and understood between by the people who create and maintain Humanitarian Open Source Software (HOSS) and users of the HOSS. In addition, how do human-centred designers themselves, engage with and contribute to HOSS and why. The aim of this critical exploration is to better understand what practices support a collaborative, inclusive and human-centred design process for the HOSS and if the use of the HOSS and relationship to the HOSS, by the beneficiaries, is changed through these human-centred design practices. This research aims to discover insights on the potential impact that collaborative and inclusive human-centred design contributions have on HOSS. The context of this work will be selected projects in affected, humanitarian crisis or human rights activist locations where HOSS is most in most prevalent use. The HOSS themselves, typically being international and ‘open’ projects used across multiple countries for humanitarian purposes.
Attention will be given to cultural and location specific influence factors for the HOSS and human-centred design methods including the ‘online’ or ‘digital’ location.


## Research context and summary
Open Source Software (OSS) developed to support humanitarian
projects are increasingly providing much needed technical and
collaborative resource that can facilitate global community action
during crises. A notable example of humanitarian OSS is Humanitarian
OpenStreetMap Team (HOT); online mapping software used to
consolidate mapping efforts through crowd-sourcing via a global
volunteer base in developed and developing countries (HOT, 2020).
HOT has, for example, been used by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)
and in-country humanitarian responders to locate and map places
that lack official or comprehensive mapping of facilities for crises like
the 2014 Ebola epidemic across western and central Africa (M Dittus et
al. 2016).
Most significantly is how humanitarian open source software (HOSS)
can support citizens and activists who have limited access to secure
digital tools for achieving social justice work. This means they can
reach global audiences while their information, identities and
locations are protected. This is particularly important in countries
where digital infrastructures can be controlled by oppressive
governments. HOSS projects therefore often derive from an egalitarian
agenda aiming to equalise a field of software commerce to build
technologies that would not be ‘commercially viable’ for proprietary
software.
Furthermore, much of this software seeks to create encrypted secure
communications to ensure those who use it remain anonymous and
safe, while information is secure (e.g. Arab Spring supported by Signal
(Vavra, ‘Signal vows to fight blockage in Iran amid newfound
popularity’ 2021) and Telegram’s (Maréchal, 2018) encryption and
journalists in Sudan avoiding using government discoverable Google
docs to share information about internet shutdowns and killings).
Typically open source software projects involve collective efforts to
improve the availability of software, and those that use it will
contribute technical improvements by way of ‘paying’ for their use.

Developing open source software is also now an important aspect of
software engineering education and professional development
allowing engineers a continuous place to learn, practice, share and
collaborate (Yunwen Ye et al. 2003). We can therefore make a
reasonable assumption that Engineers/Developers (people who code)
have some existing mental models and cultural practices when moving
from OSS to HOSS.
Many human-centred designers with hopes of contributing to open
source projects have limited prior experience or exposure through
formal or informal education and, unlike engineers, self-initiate
discovery of OSS against a culture of gatekeeping (Rajanen et al. 2015). 

When these humanitarian open source software are not made in a human-centred way, and the people that use them are not involved in a process that centres them, the software could put these vulnerable user-beneficiaries at risk. Previous research has been done to ‘introduce’ HCI specialists and designers in to OSS spaces with limited success (Hedberg et al. 2009) where designers are the ones asked to modify culture and practices to ‘fit’ within OSS governance and hierarchy structures (Mikko Rajanen et al 2015) which conflicts with observations outside for the OSS technology space where generally there is an increased recognition for human-centred design (HCD) led technology contributes to business related goals like revenue and growth (McKinsey ‘The business value of design’ 2018) (Mohan ‘The Growing Importance Of Design In The Tech World’ 2020). Within the ‘social innovation’ or humanitarian technology sector, software that is designed in a human-centred way creates a more accessible, usable and relevant experience for beneficiaries of the social innovation purpose (Selloni et al. 2017). These examples describe when human-centred design is done for beneficiaries in a passive ‘receiving sense’. When we begin to explore ideas from authors like Ezio Manzini in the book ’Design, When Everybody Designs: An Introduction to Design for Social Innovation’ we begin to understand how human-centred design processes in partnership (or co-creation) with other stakeholders of the social innovation (or technology) we begin to see connections to how open source software is typically co-created by collaborators.

“Social innovation refers to changes in the way individuals or communities act to solve a problem or to generate new opportunities. These innovations are driven more by changes in behaviour than by changes in technology” Initiatives like Access Now and Electronic Frontier Foundation, have supported access to HOSS that protect vulnerable people and now include human-centred design as part of their expanding focus (Abu-Salma et al. 2015) (Postigo 2008). HOSS maintainers benefit through collaborations with designers by gaining critical, expert insights from diverse, distributed designers that facilitate and focus the needs of the users (Raza et al. 2012). These initiatives allow increased understanding of the need for human-centred design in the humanitarian space but have many barriers including IP, ownership, data protection and security. These can impact on overall contributions and risk becoming ‘closed projects’ where design input is rarely sustained beyond specific events and projects (like with social innovation design involvement) with an ultimate goal as a commercial or fundable venture.

My research therefore aims to explore these connections around ‘successful’ human-centred designer involvement in social innovation, human-centred design involvement in non-humanitarian OSS and the collaboration between human-centred designers, people who manage Humanitarian Open Source Software (HOSS) and user-beneficiaries of the software work towards inclusive, collaborative, socially-innovative contributions on specific humanitarian needs expressed through the HOSS.

## RESEARCH CONTEXT
Open Source Software (OSS) developed to support humanitarian projects are increasingly providing much needed technical and
collaborative resource that can facilitate global community action during crises. A notable example of humanitarian OSS is
Humanitarian Open Street Map (HOSM); online mapping software used to consolidate mapping efforts through crowd-sourcing via a
global volunteer base in developed and developing countries (HOT, 2020). HOSM has, for example, been used by doctors without
borders and in-country humanitarian responders to locate and map places that lack official or comprehensive mapping of facilities
(Dittus et al. 2016).
Most significantly is how humanitarian open source software (HOSS) can support citizens and activists who have limited access to
secure digital tools for achieving social justice work. This means they can reach global audiences while their information, identities and
locations are protected. This is particularly important in countries where digital infrastructures can be controlled by oppressive
governments. HOSS projects therefore often derive from an egalitarian agenda aiming to equalise a field of software commerce to
build technologies that would not be ‘commercially viable’ for proprietary software. Furthermore much of this software seeks to
create encrypted secure communications to ensure those who use it remain anonymous and safe, while information is secure (e.g.
Arab Spring supported by Signal and Telegram’s encryption and journalists in Sudan avoiding using government discoverable Google
docs to share information about internet shutdowns and killings).
Typically open source software projects involve collective efforts to improve the availability of software, and those that use it will
contribute technical improvements by way of ‘paying’ for their use. Developing open source software is also now an important aspect
of software engineering education and professional development allowing engineers a continuous place to learn, practice, share and
collaborate (Henrik Hedberg et al. 2009). Engineers therefore have templates when moving from OSS to HOSS. However when these

HOSS tools are not human-centred by design and the people that use them are not involved in the design process, the software can risk
sharing sensitive information on vulnerable groups if the specific situated contexts of use are not well understood.
There is increased demand and recognition for more human-centred design (HCD) skills as they enable accessible, usable and relevant
‘for good’ technologies, yet many human-centred designers contributing to open source projects have limited exposure through formal
and informal education and, unlike engineers, self-initiate discovery of OSS against a culture of gatekeeping (Mikko Rajanen et al.
2015). For example initiatives like Access Now and Electronic Frontier Foundation, have supported access to HOSS that protect
vulnerable people and now include Human Centred Design (HCD) as part of their expanding focus. HOSS maintainers benefit through
collaborations with designers by gaining critical, expert insights from diverse, distributed designers that facilitate and focus the needs of
the users (Arif Raza et al. 2012). These initiatives allow increased understanding of the need for HCD in the humanitarian space but
have many barriers including IP, ownership, data protection and security. These can impact on overall contributions from users and
projects risk becoming ‘closed projects’ where design input is rarely sustained beyond specific events and projects with an ultimate goal
as a commercial or fundable venture.
My research therefore aims to critically explore how collaboration between human-centred designers, people who manage
Humanitarian Open Source Software (HOSS) and users of the software work towards improving contributions on specific human rights
issues.

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
1. How do activists, vulnerable communities and humanitarian organisations currently describe and practice their engagements
with HOSS and the value of design on issues of ‘dying’ language survival, data security and protection from human rights
abuses?
2. How do activists, communities and designers envision, describe and articulate future collaborative approaches for HOSS?
3. What human rights centred design mechanisms and resources could support collaborative HOSS for communities of practice
engaged in data-based activism and social justice?

## RESEARCH METHODS:
The research methodology will focus on participatory design informed by autoethnographic and ethnographic observations and
interviews.
In year 1 key training in qualitative methods will take place alongside relationship building with two key HOSS projects (Cryptpad and
Storyweaver) the connected user community and the local and international human centred design contribution community, semistructured
interviews, human rights activist shadowing, to gain detailed project understanding.
In years 2 & 3 field work with HOSS and communities as facilitated through participatory design workshops, qualitative interviews and
participant observation that will lead into the development of improvable resources to be tested with target communities.
Year 4 will be dedicated to synthesis writing activities to include consolidation of the reflective, critical analysis of the studies that will
be openly published while working with the Open Source Initiative.

###  How have your prior qualifications and/or professional experience equipped you for doctoral study in terms of the research skills and subject knowledge needed to undertake this project?

I have two years experience as a Lead Designer within non-profit, humanitarian OSS technology organisation Ushahidi. Here I gained
valuable have community development experience working in partnership with other OSS projects. At Ushahidi I led fieldwork in
resilience and community development in Kenya, Northern-Ireland and Kazakhstan (funded by Rockerfeller, partnered with Peace
TechLab) and peacebuilding technology in Rwanda and Kenya with the Isooko consortium. I also have 7 years of in-depth community
development experience as part of Cardiff Communities 2.0 and Adamsdown Community Project.


###  Please provide details of the resources and facilities you expect to use, including details of any high cost equipment, fieldwork, training, etc.

My research will significantly benefit from the collaborative and interdisciplinary research expertise, supervision and environment
of CoCreate, within the School of Design and the Centre for International Development in the School of Social Sciences. Speci fic
training provided on participatory design practices, ethical practice within international challenge-led research and qualitative
data collection and analysis will be fundamental. Internal GCRF small grant scheme and the Mozilla research fund will be sour ced
to support two international field trips and workshops as detailed in years 2 and 3 (£6,000).

### State why your project is particularly suited to the X Consortium:

The research would benefit from the 42 month period of professional development to enhance my existing expertise in
humanitarian open source software design, while accessing essential networks and skills necessary to advance the field. The
interdisciplinary nature of research in bridging perspectives from development studies and design, the different people involved
with open source software and the complexity of the humanitarian contexts in which this software is used would also benefit from
this focused extended period of research, particularly in seeking to have impact with grassroots organisations and communities
working on issues of social justice.
