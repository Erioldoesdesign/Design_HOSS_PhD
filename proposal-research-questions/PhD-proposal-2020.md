# "How do human centred design contributions impact Humanitarian Open Source Software? 
## A critical exploration in how human centred designers participate in and improve humanitarian Open Source Software.

## Proposal Summary

This research will critically explore how collaboration between human centred designers, people who manage Humanitarian Open Source Software (HOSS) and users of that software work towards improving the user-centred design of the HOSS. 
Through community-based participatory workshops and qualitative research, this project will work in affected, humanitarian locations where HOSS is most prevalent, for example India with ‘dying’ language translation, Australia with supply-chain traceability and with human rights journalists in developing countries with encrypted information sharing. This research will discover insights on the impact that design contributions have on HOSS and also the front-line users of HOSS tools.

## Research Context
Open Source Software (OSS) developed to support humanitarian projects are increasingly providing much needed technical resource that can facilitate global community action during crises. Typically these projects involve collective efforts to improve the availability and functionality of software, and those that use the OSS will contribute technical improvements by way of ‘paying’ for their use. A notable example of humanitarian OSS is Humanitarian Open Street Map (HOSM); mapping software available for smart phones and the internet used to consolidate mapping efforts through crowd sourcing via a global volunteer base within both developed and developing countries (HOT, 2020). HOSM has, for example, been used by doctors without borders and in-country humanitarian responders in order to locate and map places that lack official or comprehensive mapping of facilities (Dittus et al. 2016).
OSS is now an important aspect of software engineering education and professional development allowing software engineers a continuous place to learn, practice, share and collaborate (Henrik Hedberg et al. 2009). Therefore engineers have a template of sorts when moving from OSS to HOSS. However, many human-centred designers contributing to digital platforms have limited exposure through formal and informal education and unlike engineers, self-initiate discovery of OSS against a culture of gatekeeping (Mikko Rajanen et al. 2015). 
HOSS’s relationship with engineers is well studied to date (Heidi Ellis et al.2007) whereas human centred design (HCD) in HOSS is unstudied. Largely due to HCD’s recent adoption in commercial software and subsequently OSS (Erez Nusem et al. 2017)
However, there is increased demand and recognition for HCD skills as they enable accessible, usable and relevant ‘for good’ technology supported by initiatives like OpenIDEO and tech4good. 
These initiatives allow increased understanding of the need for HCD in the humanitarian space but have barriers (IP, ownership, NDA, security) to contribution and are ‘closed projects’ where design input is rarely sustained beyond specific events and projects with an ultimate goal is a commercial/fundable venture. HOSS offers less barriers to contribution. In HOSS, designers assist in building and improving via regular, recognised contribution cycles that software engineers currently practice. 

Why is HCD needed in HOSS? HOSS  by its nature aims to provide tools for some of the most complex and challenging crises that humans globally face, from mapping street harassment in Egypt, to journalist freedom fighters exchanging media under dictatorships and protesters in Hong Kong using decentralised HOSS tools to organise safely. These tools directly save and preserve lives and freedoms. When these HOSS tools are not human centred and the people that use them are not involved in the process of improvement or creation then they are put in dangerous positions. When OSS is not human centred it is a hindrance and rarely life threatening. HOSS follows OSS’s lead where improvements bias towards in functionality instead of usability (Modestos Stavrakis et al. 2007). 
Initiatives like Access Now and Electronic Frontier Foundation, have supported access to HOSS that protect vulnerable people. These initiatives now include HCD as part of their expanding focus.
HOSS maintainers benefit through collaborations with designers by gaining critical, expert insights from diverse, distributed designers that facilitate and focus the needs of the users (Arif Raza et al. 2012)


## Research Questions

* What gaps can be identified in the ways that HOSS projects currently interact and communicate with designers and users that differ in their interaction and communication with engineers? 
Gap analysis of HOSS, designer/s and user interactions and communications.

* From these gaps, how can we inform designers, HOSS and users with complementary knowledge of each other in order to better collaborate?
Testable information exchange structure between HOSS, Designer/s and users with M&E of the impact of the testable structure.

* What mechanisms could support greater collaboration between stakeholders (HOSS, designers, users) to support HOSS to achieve results for communities in need of humanitarian assistance?
Facilitated collaborative workshops.

* Can we measure the impact of human-centred design on HOSS from these collaboration mechanisms?
Statistical analysis of the impact HCD contributions have had on the HOSS, focusing on meeting user needs.

* What does a peer-support, global, collaborative design community need in order to support itself when collaborating with and on HOSS?
Qualitative data from stakeholders that informs recommendations for community structures that indenture healthy HCD contribution to HOSS.

## Research Methods

Working with 2 HOSS projects per year for 4 years, participatory design workshops, qualitative interviews and participant observation will inform reflective, critical and analytical writings that will be openly published.
