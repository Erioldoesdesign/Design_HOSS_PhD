### Text from Chris Emmerson:
It is common that most deposits in data.ncl will be licenced under a version of Creative Commons but this approach is not suitable for software. Within in data.ncl there a two licence routes you can choose for software:  

Permissive (weak copyleft): MIT and Apache 2.0 allow the code to be used and redistributed under different licences and used for commercial uses. 

Strongly protective (strong copyleft): GPL 3.0+ dictates that when a future piece of software contains some of your code, the software must be distributed under the same licences (i.e. prevents software from becoming proprietary/ commercial use).
