Turning points - Protagonists need life to be difficult. Appear to be going great but a key moment turns the screw - something big changes.

What it’s about - A study into design and HR’s and OSS, where use of OSS in HR’s started and why? in relation to what in OSS generally?, how it’s developed and why? How the HR’s orgs have understood and involved design

What it’s really about - Why it’s important to have a user centred approach to OSS by involving designers and why it saves lives.

Kenyan Elections in 2007 - Ushahidi’s tech founders building

Kenya was coming up to its first democratic elections in 2007 and unrest, misinformation and violence had been simmering.

In Kibera (Nairobi), west Kenya in Kisumu and across the highlands of Kenya those that are trying to exercise democratic rights were stopped from doing so, through intimidation, coercion and violence, influenced by tribal interests. The three founders, spread across Kenya and the USA were talking with friends and loved ones across various communications, some safe and secure from malicious monitoring, some not so. Yet the need to communicate among each other and to the wider world about what was happening was desperate. These three founders, technology enthusiasts embedded in the ‘silicon savanna’ of Nairobi saw the need to communicate safely, on mass and hold Kenya’s government accountable to the rest of the world. They started to build a way for citizens to speak openly anonymously. As they built they did so openly, with the intention that no one person, organisation or entity was in possession of this communications tool that was for the people, by the people, sparked by these three. They handed over the communications tool to the people, under an open legal license so that it might be continued into the future and belong to the people in order to speak their truth to the world. These communications from the people would go on to hold governments and organisations accountable on a world wide scale.

In later Kenyan elections the communications tool would be used again, alongside volunteers on the ground doing the ‘humanitarian work’ zooming around on boda boda motorbikes to visit election sites that were reported on using the OSS software.

It was likely not the first humanitarian and human rights focused OSS but it is one of the most well known. 

## Likely not the first humanitarian and human rights focused OSS

The ways in which technology (namely software) have been used in human rights situations are hard to quantify, especially when we look within the world of OSS where access to the tools are free and open by default and therefore the use cases undocumented and endless by their own design. A human rights writer using Libre office for their writing, then self publishing using web technologies that are free and open, both in coding language and in infrastructure (Drupal, Wordpress etc.)

When I first worked with humanitarian/human rights trauma in design and how critical that is to the software.

The problem and how we can address this
