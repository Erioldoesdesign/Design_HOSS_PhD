# Voice

### Three problems I see in my thesis

1. Designers ‘role’ is not understood by FOSS clearly.
2. The way that FOSS understands ‘users’ is flawed and ‘gate-keeped’, especially in Humanitarian and Human Rights contexts.
3. Design’s history is colonial and its practices still embody that, the freedom in Free and open source software is a critical principle as it is in Humanitarian and Human rights. How can design participate in an anti-colonial way.

***What is it I really want my reader to understand about this issue or section***

We’re so caught up with the ‘powerful’ actors in this 3-way ecosystem, the FOSS, the Humanitarian/Human Rights institution and the Design institution in that we often forget that the central meaning, the pivot is the humans at the centre of these actors and processes, the ‘user’ and by arguing around the cultures of these three actors, how we loose the perspective of the humans at risk, and in need of usable humanitarian and human rights tools, designed with them i participation.

***What is it I really want my reader to understand about this word/phrase***

we loose the perspective of the humans at risk

Without these humans that are at risk being centred in the processes of the three actors we end up arguing endlessly about who has the most validity, relevance, value in the process. What skills, history and purpose these three have when the validity, value and purpose sits with the central humans at risk.

### What is voice?

Creativity, Consistency, Character, Tone, Critical Thinking, Personality, Story telling, Expertise, Perspective, Humor, Context, Audacity, Playfulness, Confidence, Purpose, authority, conciseness, experience, authenticity, delivery, guide, understanding, empathy.

Over familiarity with ourself or people that know about the subject → voice becomes flat and non-empathetic to ‘the reader’.

Imposter Syndrome → voice is ‘too much’.

Communicating

How do the puzzle pieces fit together

Voice is the connective tissue

### 3 words

**Direct** - this is where we’re going, why. Or this is where we are and why it’s important.

**Guide** - We’re at this point and that means X but what do we need to address X in this or the problem is or what’s interesting about this is X. How does it relate to the argument and why is it important.

**Reflect** - Is that always the case, are we asking the wrong question, what if Y was the case or in another situation.

### Connective tissue practice

A designers role in OSS can get complicated quickly. 

Designers working as paid staff on OSS are commonly as a solo designer performing a diverse array of design functions, inclusive of design research, co-design, product and visual design and iterative improvements. All while ideally operating ‘in the open’ and in collaboration with globally distributed technology teams. 

The ‘staff OSS designers’ however are often privy to details that un-paid, volunteer design contributor would not be, usually due to data sensitivity factors or in this auto-ethnographic case, because the consortium grant to fund the work that the OSS was part of allowed for ‘non-open’ activities more common to commercial or proprietary software environments e.g. meetings where notes were not shared on open repositories (an openly accessible space online to view files, code or other data).

 Often this reason is for data privacy reasons the users of the open source software but in my experience it’s partly due to the immense labour of the designer in order to make everything about the design process openly accessible. In this sense, the staff OSS designer (and wider OSS staff) is not operating in a ‘fully open’ way as there will always be some information not accessible to a volunteer contributor designer. 

A volunteer contributor design (un-paid in OSS) will only have access to what is openly available to them through the means of which they understand how to access it. They often contribute similar design functions to the staff designer in OSS but while missing the context of the staff OSS designer.

The point here is...that the complications of the role allow the designer, staff or volunteer, to become alienated from the human’s (users) at the centre of the humanitarian / human rights open source software. Further research is required to asses how the loss of the human/user of the HOSS affects how the HOSS is built, by whom, with whom and how that then is ‘received’ back by the humans in the humanitarian/human rights context. It is essential to asses how that complication affects the HOSS used in humanitarian and human rights crisis.

**Main argument:** When designers ‘loose’ sight of the human-centred people at Hum/HR crisis through the ‘politics’ of the three actors they are in that act of absorbed distraction not embodying the critical value that design can bring to HOSS by facilitating or bridging the voice of the humans to the Hum/HR + OSS.

**Counter point:** But is the act of participating in the ‘politics’ of Hum/HR, OSS and design the ‘fee’ to practice? is it a requirement and can it be removed?

The interesting thing about this is...
