### Here’s this particular concrete thing that encapsulates or contextualises the issues I’m thinking about: notes about a possible walk-in...

When I spoke with Person X who had survived a hurricane in no small part due to the technology tools that allowed for them to get to safety I was truck by the essentiality of these tools for preserving life. Yet they were ‘steps removed’ from the process of how the tool was made.

When I asked the missing maps volunteers who mapped those areas what they believed to be critical they mention, tech stability, funding, volunteer numbers etc. Yet the inclusion of the people that could be and were affected by this crisis was missed.

When I asked designer 1 at humanitarian project I heard the desperation of how they contextualised the lives and experiences of the humanitarian or human rights crisis in the construct of the tool. “We can’t have the way you do X not include ways that they can do that when X, Y and Z”

## This is surprising/interesting/striking/useful in the context of what I am thinking about because...

## It raises interesting questions which I would like to focus on in this chapter...

### My goal in doing so is to show you/help you better understand...

### Ultimately in this chapter I am going to argue...

### This takes a different approach/builds on/breaks away from/uses a different perspective/sheds light on this unexplored area (summary of existing scholarship which highlights my original contribution)...

### So first, (in order to convince you of this line I’m taking) we need to understand/appreciate/consider...

### Then list your points - points not content - that will take your reader on that journey...
