It appears as if the origins of free software (different to open source software in some circles) was created to solve an immediate need (the printer in MIT office would jam and therefore the coder/s RM Stallman built a SMS text system that would message everyone who had something in the printer queue so that the printer never stayed jammed long). In this respect I see and notice the ‘user need’ but here we also have the proficiency barrier of the skills needed to modify the printers source code in order to solve for the communal need. The creation of Free software (free as in freedom and ‘free speech’) came about when the upgraded printers source code was not available for modification and therefore the solution for the previous printer was unable to be replicated in this ‘closed’ new printers environment.

Here I can see some attempts at rudimentary user research, possibly with an embedded ethnographic element to it given that RMS (the coder who built the printer jam messenger) was himself a user of that printer and by solving the problem for himself, he solved it for many but in a very multi user inclusive way - he could have simply made a messaging system that sent a message to a single person or whomever is responsible for that ‘unjamming task’ but he took a commons approach to the solution.

From here RMS founded the free software foundation and built some of the first openly available operating systems and tools along with the GNU public license which detailed the values of copyleft (play on words from copyright). Sharing, modifying and freedom were integral to these first creations by the free software movement and even though they are practicing some design thinking methods they are not explicitly naming it as so - the drive appears to come from a ‘right to modify and share’. Without seeing how these modifications were made (by homogenous groups in ‘closed’ settings - closed by nature of ability to modify and share functional code) as opposed to a multi-disciplined collaborative model I cannot comment on the ‘user centred-ness’ of the free software though I can see an attempt at limited inclusion of ‘the user’

The pivotal moment comes in when Raymond publishes ‘The cathedral and the bazaar’ and states “treating users as co-developers are all fundamental to modern software development.” is a much clearer indication of inclusion of those that (only) use as well as those that use, modify and share back.

The divergence into the term ‘open source’ and the tension there with ‘free software’ while semantic may come into play when thinking about humanitarian and human rights OSS - free as in freedom and open as in available are both good statements and commitments but unknown is the efforts to which early designers as facilitators went to in order to ensure the use-only-user was heard and included within the work of those that use as well as modify and share back.

A tension is see in the early days of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is summarised by this from RM Stallman “Stallman argued that removing the focus on freedom would lead to a future where source code would be available, but the user of the software would not be able to avail of the freedom to modify the software” Reading the intention here I am leaning towards Stallman thinking that the source code would be open as in available and viewable but not directly editable in an accessible (or at all) way. While this has some what come to pass in modern FOSS there is an additional reading of this statement in that yes, most FOSS is open, available and modifiable by anyone that ‘discovers’ it but the barriers to modification compound from the discovery point: Discovery, Understandability, Personal infrastructure/access to internet etc. and then ability as with modification with intent to share comes with the price of it needing to function as the modifier (and others) intend it to - and here is where the process to which designers as facilitators come in, in that a modification is intended to be made, how does that work for a ‘majority’ of use cases and/or the most critical use cases. When we shift our thinking to FOSS intended for humanitarian or human rights uses, this ‘making it work for a ‘majority’ of use cases and/or the most critical use cases’ can become a matter of whether life, safety and freedoms are preserved during humanitarian and human rights ‘action’. 

Here the modifiers of the code may make a change to ‘fit a perceived need’ but unless that need is understood within contexts and co-design with the people it affects can it really be upholding humanitarian and human rights principles or truly be speaking to the intention of free and open source software’s founding principles of freedom and open to all.

The history of free and open software started out straightforward. The people that were part of the communities across California and the USA, in universities were the first to co-create the foundations of the free and open source operating systems which steadily led to other universities, volunteers and later companies participating in the growth and breath of free and open source software available for use.

Where free and open source software started to become increasingly widely know is during the late 90’s and early 2000’s where proprietary, for profit companies created ‘departments’ dedicated to collaborating with university developers and volunteers and then would late create non-profit foundations in order to ‘steward’ the software in a way that was as impartial to the host companies goals as possible. Here in the late 90’s and early 2000’s was when the Mozilla Foundation split from Netscape and others like Debian, GNOME, Apache and Eclipse were in operation, maintaining, stewarding and building free and open source software with people.

Mentions of ‘users’ here are sparse. Users of the free and open source software during this time were the university employees, the for-profit employees and those that built the non-profit foundations. Only the hastily mentioned ‘volunteers’ could be suspected of not being your ‘expected’ user - perhaps with an unrelated job (not in computing or engineering) and functioned more as enthusiasts or hobbyists. Possibly this is where the ‘unknowing’ FOSS user begins to emerge - those that are completely unrelated to the contributing FOSS ecosystem yet have been provided with, and required to use FOSS in order to do another job e.g. a data entry or computer based job in the late 90’s or early 2000’s perhaps early computer based accountants or even the university researchers that did not study coding but because of the early initiation and adoption of FOSS within the universities ecosystem, inherited a technology stack that was comprised of FOSS.

Looking into the late 90’s and early 2000’s history is where i might then find crossover with where the first instance of FOSS being used or created for humanitarian and human rights purposes, Ushahidi’s being in 2007 being the earliest I know of. This also would suggest that we zoom out and away from the USA and observe what is being done in countries that have existing and prominent humanitarian and human rights needs during the late 90’s and early 2000’s.

I find it interesting that there is little to no mention of what was going on technologically during the late 90’s and early 2000’s in terms of university led free and open source software advances. Indeed it is highly likely that the universities involved with research into humanitarian and human rights cases would have been using software to ‘facilitate’ there workload but it is unlikely that these softwares would have been in the hands of the humans at risk nor encouraged to participate themselves directly, but possibly indirectly through a design facilitation process.

Question: Was Ushahidi in 2007 really the first case of humanitarian/human rights free and open source software?

Question: What was the IFRC doing at that point?

This paper (from Paul Currion, Chamindra de Silva, Bartel Van de Walle) on the Sahana (disaster information system) has a number of assumptions that are questionable given current context and has a tone of ‘aspiration’ and ‘scarcity’ regarding the usefulness of the software.

The first questionable assumption 

*“although there is an initial cost in setting up a FOSS disaster management system in terms of technical support, the system has no cost to procure and is low cost to maintain. This overcomes some of the basic resource constraints that affect many governmental and non-governmental organizations. This particularly addresses the problem of lack of funding before a disaster strikes or any administrative constraints that would require a long procurement process for a high-cost license.”*

Initial costs to set up FOSS were perhaps, less costly when this paper was written in 2007, but the cost would have been still linked to an existing capability, knowledge and access to infrastructure in order to deploy the software as it is here in 2022. It still remains relatively true that the cost to ‘spin up’ tools (providing you have the skills, interest, time and infrastructure) can be done at zero cost to an individual or group, but the costs are often hidden in the critical infrastructure, for example. In 2018 the south west of India in the Kerala region saw devastating flood activity and in response, volunteers (students, governments, organisations etc.) responded to the need for co-ordinated information on the disaster by using Ushahidi’s self-hosted OSS data collection platform to create a fast, zero monetary cost way of collecting and understanding the ‘situation on the ground’. The hidden cost here is that Ushahidi, like many of its similar tools, is not zero cost and has organisational costs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The ‘fast and zero cost’ way of using FOSS tools in order to respond to a disaster rarely has zero cost and the hidden, critical infrastructure cost needs emphasizing. To extend the critical costs further, Ushahidi’s tool is written in php, an open source coding language which itself has costs associated with its continued existence. FOSS does not address the problem of lack of funding before a disaster strikes, it simply shifts the cost to the OSS infrastructure that they utilise.

A further comment made by the scholars is “*In addition, FOSS development leverages the goodwill and expertise of a global community of IT and non-IT actors at no cost.” the cost is not zero, as stated above there are hidden costs that are shifted around.* However in making this comment, the scholars are noticing something that is largely absent from many texts on open source and humanitarian/human rights work which is the ‘non-IT actors’.  Here we can make an assumption that ‘non-IT actors’ are inclusive of designers and design functions.
