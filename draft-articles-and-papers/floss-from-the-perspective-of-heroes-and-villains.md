# FLOSS from the perspective of Heroes and Villains 

Hero - The users and activists that use HR’s OSS

Specific Hero - Ushahidi founder’s? Sahana’s founders? Question who are the hero’s of Humanitarian/Human Rights OSS?

Specific Hero - Techfugee’s enabling those in informal settlements and refugee camps access, time and training to the spaces and expertise in which their voices are heard and able to be contributed.

Hidden Hero - The digital infrastructure that enables the HR’s use of OSS

Villain - The prioritisation and glorification of code as contribution

Hidden Villain - ‘Rockstar’ developers

Opportunities - What would it mean to work ‘with’ the villain’s?

**Villain perspective on user centred OSS**

The rockstar developers of the history of OSS believe already that the tools are user centred because they make them, modify them and maintain them along with those that ‘pass’ the bar of participation in a similar way, here perpetuating the cycle of rockstar developers that are all-knowing all seeing maintainers of the software that they create that underpins the HR’s activists and people that use them on the ground. To make ‘HOSS’ more user centred is a non-starter for them as it is already user centred and designed well. The essential need is met and therefore the need to ‘make pretty’ the tools that are already functioning well is wasted resources in what could make the tools more secure, feature rich etc.

**Hero perspective**

The hero’s on the other hand are in the field, struggling to use the HOSS tools in the way that they were fully intended to, perhaps they lack safety, context, time or stable country infrastructure in order to use these tools (e.g. in rural east Africa/pan Africa where stable secure wifi or 3g is a commodity not available to many like in the informal settlements).
