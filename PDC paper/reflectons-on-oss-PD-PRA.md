The reflections on open source software around participatory design and participatory action, action research and i'm going to specifically speak about one project when open source software project, I was hired on as a staff member, so these reflections are within the sphere of a paid role which I do believe becomes important when we talk about the nature of open source software and participatory design generally and how this manifests when we talk about a specific aspect of open source software in the form of contributions, which are often voluntary, so this is a contentious point already in the reflections on open source software as a designer doing participatory design work and the valuing of that work paid and unpaid contributions and the kind of unclear sense of what those two things mean in the terms of value.

To reference a single project within this open source software organization I'm just going to call it 'Org A' so that I don't name the organization specifically. This project was the biggest and most prominent example of active participatory design efforts that I could recall and can observe retrospectively.
I participated in the project as a practicing designer within that organization and while I do think it's important and useful to reflect on other projects and other ways that participatory design appeared in this open source software 'Org A', but I want to focus in on this one project first and add my reflections there before I go broader, although it will actually be relatively hard to not go broader.

Participatory design is the human-centered approach to a co-design engagement with users and stakeholders and it doesn't necessarily have a set end date, as it were, so participatory design in and of itself can be a engagement of some description with users/participants for however long that is. PD doesn't necessarily say that you have to 'do PD' throughout the whole project, it could be parts of the project as long as I think specific methods and activities and engagements are used, it can then be participatory design and I do think that.

For this reflection it's important to try and clarify that quite early on, given the nature of this specific project that I worked on within 'Org A'. This open source software already existed, and it existed for more than 10 years it's been used in various different ways for more than 10 years and it's as a community empowerment OSS tool around many different kinds of humanitarian and humans rights purposes/cases. This reflection is on a specific project that was a consortium funded from the EU across three years to look at how technology (generally) can be used during peace education and peace building efforts in East Africa, specifically in Rwanda and Kenya.

I (the PD designer) worked with a number of other consortium organizations, including three universities and other commercial technology companys/NGO's and 'Org A' ourselves was as a technology partner with NGO status with existing open source software.

Relfections on the intricacies of the consortium and how it was funded is interestinga nd does impact the PD and OSS but isn't the sole focus of this reflection because that isn't necessarily what the focus of participatory design and open source was. The focus was with the peace building and education 'end users' (CSO's and public etc.) and the intersections between these 'end users'.
It's worth stating in a reflective way that many of the partners in the consortium had a very unclear idea of what they were responsible for doing either individually on the consortium project deliverables and most importantly, collectively as consortium partners. There were a number of different people/organisations within this consortium that were really quite confused as to what their part to play on in this was and on relfection the participatory design element of the project was hard to grasp by most of the consortium. It was most readily engaged with by consortium partners that were reliant on the PD aspects of the project in order to meet their own deliverables.

On reflection to unpack that more in terms of open source and participatory design it meant that it was very difficult to, as the designer dleivering on the PD engagements, to know, plan for and understand at what points different consortium partners wanted and in what kind of responsibiliy capacity for their own deliverables of the funded work.

This impacted how we did the participatory design elements of the technology project workshops and engagements and meant that we didn't always know what stakeholders we were including or working with or what their needs or goals were.

In terms of not informing the participatory design elements, but their level of engagement and an understanding of the participatory design elements in terms and.

45
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:29.310
Eriol Fox Reichelt: In under the lens of what the technology output could be, as well as their own output, so a couple of the other organizations within the consortium had outputs that we're not necessarily technology or not necessarily the process of.

46
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.170
Eriol Fox Reichelt: doing things but we're like educational package, where core.

47
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:46.380
Eriol Fox Reichelt: other kind of pieces of work like we had a university partner that was about analyzing a particular methodology that we're using a methodology was.

48
00:08:47.970 --> 00:09:06.330
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Living labs, which is an interesting and useful method methodology for open sources it's i'm supposed to say quite close to an open source way of doing things and also very participatory user led way of doing things so it made sense like on paper, as it were.

49
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:19.500
Eriol Fox Reichelt: But I think that one of the things, one of the next reflections that i'll go into is when we began doing the participatory design work with with users and participants.

50
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:28.740
Eriol Fox Reichelt: was something that I found really key is the as the organization that was responsible for doing the.

51
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:42.270
Eriol Fox Reichelt: participatory kind of engagements that I was as the lead designer on this project for the technology partner, the organization a it was very difficult to kind of understand what.

52
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:51.060
Eriol Fox Reichelt: How how and what parts of the methodology from the University partners goals side of things need to be included, and how and why.

53
00:09:51.960 --> 00:10:08.610
Eriol Fox Reichelt: So it was it was kind of difficult to really focused solely on the outcomes of the participatory nate the participatory elements and kind of use those to really inform how the tools are bell or how the.

54
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:16.830
Eriol Fox Reichelt: project was informed, because we had a lot of other organizations basically.

55
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:30.150
Eriol Fox Reichelt: reliant on certain ways of expressing outputs still already, I think that one of the things that I want to express as a reflection of doing this participatory design within this open source consortium project space was.

56
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:42.240
Eriol Fox Reichelt: That there was as often as in lots of kinds of design projects open source or not when you've got multiple stakeholders that there was already an idea of what we wanted it to look like.

57
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:49.560
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Before we even began to do the engagements and one of the toughest things was making sure that we could.

58
00:10:51.630 --> 00:11:04.200
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Have that exploratory element of participatory design involved that we left the room to be surprised and we left for him to learn things and we left room to adapt, given the input from from real users.

59
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:16.650
Eriol Fox Reichelt: I think another reflection, just to kind of move on to the actual users and what kind of came out of things it I don't know whether we actually really effectively communicated the open source software nature of things.

60
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:25.350
Eriol Fox Reichelt: particularly well it definitely wasn't a focus of the participatory design element of the work that we did with users, that the nate.

61
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:44.310
Eriol Fox Reichelt: We I think I believe we explained what the tool was that we were working with a knowledge of not that we actually worked on the tool we worked like with the understanding of certain tools that could be used in peace building a piece education within these contexts, but.

62
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:46.620
Eriol Fox Reichelt: It was.

63
00:11:48.990 --> 00:12:00.840
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Sorry i've lost three yeah we didn't we I think we introduced Open Source so far as a potential thing that we never really established whether open source software was the thing that all of our users, that we engage with.

64
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:09.420
Eriol Fox Reichelt: had a good understanding or an informed understanding of, and that they knew kind of what that meant within the.

65
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:18.570
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Within the connection of their participatory design contributions, because I think the one of the really interesting things that I find within participatory designers.

66
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:26.370
Eriol Fox Reichelt: I believe I don't know what they're kind of cooled often that you know the artifacts or things that kind of our outputs from the users, they inform.

67
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:45.030
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Whatever is you're you're kind of doing a participatory design work on a our contributions to open source in this context, so the the way that my designer in open source software our brain worked with the participatory design elements was we.

68
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:56.070
Eriol Fox Reichelt: We had an understanding of what we wanted to learn, we had a certain amount of different things that we could do that, we agreed on that we work with stakeholders on that we.

69
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:08.730
Eriol Fox Reichelt: invited certain people to do, and that we adopted given like some inherent knowledge of civil society, organizations and public and all the different kinds of people that we're doing participatory work with and we did those things.

70
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:20.460
Eriol Fox Reichelt: And because the the direct outcome wasn't necessarily to improve our open source software, like in a very in any specific way.

71
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:36.060
Eriol Fox Reichelt: I think that one of the big reflections was the I went in with this kind of inherent knowledge of all these are open source software contributions from a design perspective built by the user, but I was not proficient enough in how to.

72
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:51.390
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Work with that, to make it work with an open source software process kind of way, so I think that this was not only kind of.

73
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.020
Eriol Fox Reichelt: cool.

74
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.440
Eriol Fox Reichelt: James can you do something about that.

75
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.140
Eriol Fox Reichelt: just give him his food in.

76
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.640
Eriol Fox Reichelt: super distracting me.

77
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:10.890
Eriol Fox Reichelt: wow.

78
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:20.310
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Well it's not it's not for the recording it's for the transcription so um.

79
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.330
Eriol Fox Reichelt: But I keep losing my thread because he keeps penetrating my brain with as many hours.

80
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:37.740
Eriol Fox Reichelt: yeah so I didn't follow a process that I probably would have now and that I have more proficiency with an open source software and and I think that I was as a.

81
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:50.490
Eriol Fox Reichelt: designer that were had the responsibility of the like custodian role of the design, were the participatory design work and feeding it back into the Open Source process, I did not do a.

82
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:59.970
Eriol Fox Reichelt: good job of I recorded and kept a lot of the insight that it went through a very funneled process in terms of the consortium process rather than becoming.

83
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:14.010
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Open Source intelligence for the for software for either our organization as open source software or other organizations peace building an education.

84
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:20.640
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Soft software open source software, so it didn't really have that kind of cyclical.

85
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:28.680
Eriol Fox Reichelt: In a contribution work feeding back into the the the nature of the.

86
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:38.640
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Vehicle the technology vehicle and I think that that was a really big reflection under failing of that project that it that it didn't really go back into this some.

87
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:51.600
Eriol Fox Reichelt: record capture, but also, I think another reflection upon that is weird anything have happened with that and I think that this is a larger reflection on participatory design and any design contributions within open source software.

88
00:15:52.110 --> 00:16:07.770
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Is that often they go into sort of like a black hole of nothingness and, in the sense that, even if they are incredibly user informed incredibly rich insights that will and can be clearly proven by being user lead that will improve the.

89
00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:21.450
Eriol Fox Reichelt: usage nature of the the open source software, the often that that needs that custodian role to take it through into the software, because there is an online wider reflection.

90
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:39.840
Eriol Fox Reichelt: a really difficult aspect of trying to take design contribution insight from participatory design work and take it into the actual tool essentially it's it's not only like a very long process it's a very convoluted communication process there's.

91
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:48.360
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Often, like with many non Open Source technology projects, there is just that unpicking of what everything means and that kind of them.

92
00:16:49.800 --> 00:17:02.340
Eriol Fox Reichelt: takes taking through a design filter or taking through the designer lens on how to actually express what those participatory design insights actually look like and also then if we wanted to go a fully participatory design.

93
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:14.940
Eriol Fox Reichelt: route actually following up and being able to do more prototyping and more co design throughout that design and technology improvement process.

94
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:22.290
Eriol Fox Reichelt: That would have been very aligned with open source and how to do an open source software process.

95
00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:34.530
Eriol Fox Reichelt: But that's where reflections on the nature of how the project was structured and how the project was funded in that that could not happen, and there was no way in which to actually take that through.

96
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:45.090
Eriol Fox Reichelt: That process for for very sort of practical organizational funding and support reasons, so there wasn't that.

97
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:58.230
Eriol Fox Reichelt: available, and I think that going back briefly to a statement I said earlier, on reflection, which was about I didn't think we adequately explained what open source software is and the nature of that, I do think that one way that you can.

98
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:07.860
Eriol Fox Reichelt: figure and factor in participatory design processes with users into an open source process with not necessarily that custodian role.

99
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:20.340
Eriol Fox Reichelt: could be that you as part of the participatory design process begin to build in the contribution process and how those users, not only own the participatory design elements of.

100
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:30.660
Eriol Fox Reichelt: The work but also begin to understand how they actually actively contribute that in and see it through the the technology build process within an open source route.

101
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:38.850
Eriol Fox Reichelt: So do you think that that's really an in an interesting reflection on how participatory design and open source processes could see.

102
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:50.970
Eriol Fox Reichelt: The users, that are part of the participatory design process become open source contributors and how that really feels to me like a natural progression of participatory design within an open environment.

103
00:18:51.600 --> 00:19:01.920
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Which is open source so so this idea that it is open visible editable remix of all in all, different ways by anybody that has you know the permissions available.

104
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:13.140
Eriol Fox Reichelt: But I do think i'm again just you know, expressing that that custodian role being that my reflection of doing wider work as a designer with an open source software is even if you have.

105
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.030
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Very.

106
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:25.740
Eriol Fox Reichelt: brave and not necessarily just technically brave or technically competent person that is really interested in contributing.

107
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:37.380
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Design from a user perspective or designer perspective back into the open source software then it's still a difficult process to engage with, and I think that further reflection on.

108
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:48.030
Eriol Fox Reichelt: participatory design and open sources that you really need that long term proficiency or that long term understanding.

109
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.130
Eriol Fox Reichelt: I hate to use this term, but there's some.

110
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:58.470
Eriol Fox Reichelt: dedication to seeing it through and that it can often just where.

111
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.990
Eriol Fox Reichelt: contributors and end users down.

112
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.470
Eriol Fox Reichelt: In terms of like just time and effort.

113
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.290
Eriol Fox Reichelt: To see that, through, because then we bring it up, we begin to bring in all the different kinds of reflections that you have.

114
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:22.260
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Trying to practice design within Open Source so then it's not just about the participatory design within Open Source it then becomes there's some.

115
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:44.040
Eriol Fox Reichelt: transition of this role of the participatory design participant then taking on like a design custodian role in a way, and I think that that is what may be required there and also then maybe one of the biggest difficulties and trying to actually.

116
00:20:46.680 --> 00:21:02.850
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Not just do participatory designers designers in working with an open source software, but actually bring in elements of the participatory process into an open source software process if that makes sense, we should should make sense um.

117
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:10.500
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Well, the other reflections that I have about that project I.

118
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:26.460
Eriol Fox Reichelt: mean, this is a a hard a hard thing to express, but I do think that there is a big cultural difference in.

119
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:38.760
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Not only open source, but in participatory design and this kind of work, and specifically doing Open Source participatory design work within a humanitarian, human rights context as well, so it's not just about.

120
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:51.960
Eriol Fox Reichelt: So this is like I think the nature of the kinds of participants within a human rights and humanitarian context in the is the technology is like a vehicle for their.

121
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.890
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Their justice expression, and freedom of those things.

122
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:13.140
Eriol Fox Reichelt: And it's not necessarily the thing that they live eat breathe sleep as many kind of open source projects that focus on like the developers and the people that use technology and it's like a tool for technology.

123
00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:21.480
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Practitioners as opposed to this as a tool for human rights and humanitarian peace building and peace, education, work so doesn't necessarily.

124
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:35.340
Eriol Fox Reichelt: You know, by its nature stipulate that you are, you know, a deeply interested in technology kind of person that you use it as a means to an end, which is peace education and peace building so.

125
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:45.420
Eriol Fox Reichelt: I do think that the nature of the participants was a interesting reflection to be worked in within open source software so.

126
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:53.910
Eriol Fox Reichelt: I reflecting back on how open source works and trying to explain open source to this kind of audience.

127
00:22:54.330 --> 00:23:08.370
Eriol Fox Reichelt: And whether we did a good good enough job with that or not, and what that might mean for participatory design, I do think that would have been one of the harder aspects of this work, given the nature of human rights and humanitarian work within this space.

128
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:17.730
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Because actually I I, on reflection, I think that these participants are much more used to a participatory design kind of.

129
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:36.300
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Environment and engagement, I think this is something that they feel very proficient in in engaging with and by nature participatory design aims to build on an or various activities that are the way of engaging stakeholders right it's.

130
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:46.710
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Not necessarily particular things about participatory design it's the nature of involvement through an activity that makes participatory design.

131
00:23:47.160 --> 00:24:03.330
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Work and relevant for the people that are then going to use the thing or or participate in the building of something and I think that za those methods are more accessible in, on reflection, and those kinds of.

132
00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:11.700
Eriol Fox Reichelt: vectors of engagement, are more successful more accessible than open source software.

133
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.700
Eriol Fox Reichelt: factors of engagement on factors of.

134
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:36.630
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Collaboration because they very quickly become about a proficiency level and technology broadly and not just about bringing your voice and bringing your thoughts and bringing your opinions and knowing how to be like knowing what you want, as a user and being able to channel that through.

135
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:45.930
Eriol Fox Reichelt: I think there's also likely this barrier with participatory design and then how the design gets expressed from from in like em.

136
00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.490
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Through to like a build kind of process but.

137
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:59.280
Eriol Fox Reichelt: i'm still kind of learning about the kinds of barriers that from the participatory designs or work process.

138
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:10.110
Eriol Fox Reichelt: flow, but I do know that own reflection Open Source processes are huge barriers in and of themselves.

139
00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.830
Eriol Fox Reichelt: But I don't think there would have been.

140
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:18.540
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Potentially as much challenge.

141
00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.770
Eriol Fox Reichelt: working outside of.

142
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:36.120
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Maybe in a global South African context really I, I think that there, this is like a tricky thing to reflect on language was that I do think that there is a.

143
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:47.610
Eriol Fox Reichelt: expectation of being engaged with around these kinds of topics that a lot of the kinds of people that we worked with have this kind of familiarity with.

144
00:25:48.120 --> 00:26:02.910
Eriol Fox Reichelt: That as a method of engagement and I think the from my experience working in communities outside of Africa there then tends to be a.

145
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:05.430
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Like.

146
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.810
Eriol Fox Reichelt: what's the word I want to, I want to express this.

147
00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:26.460
Eriol Fox Reichelt: I think that the the reflection here is the organizations and individuals across countries like Africa or receive aid and receive like these, and participate in these things regularly.

148
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:40.590
Eriol Fox Reichelt: expect there to just not be any follow up essentially because they are used to both those kinds of sure dependent power pent up, especially within the humanitarian organization like very rarely things have a longevity to them.

149
00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:45.480
Eriol Fox Reichelt: and open source has a longevity but it's requires a.

150
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.020
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Support essentially.

151
00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:08.040
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Where as I think the other countries Western countries essentially don't necessarily expect there to just be this depend approach like where they're short term engagements there tends to be and desire and I asked for what is the longer.

152
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:24.210
Eriol Fox Reichelt: term ask here and there's a dissatisfaction as well with with that, so I think that there's an interesting set of reflections that I don't know whether i'm articulated particularly well to do with the where you do the Open Source and participatory design.

153
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.390
Eriol Fox Reichelt: work together.

154
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:35.100
Eriol Fox Reichelt: And it's one of a cultural a geographical and socio political.

155
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.520
Eriol Fox Reichelt: charitable like cultural.

156
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.180
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Reflection essentially which gets complicated really quickly um.

157
00:27:49.680 --> 00:28:02.640
Eriol Fox Reichelt: I also kind of think that there was less ownership of the information I think that speaking to a cultural reflection as well there often is a sort of.

158
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.650
Eriol Fox Reichelt: expectation that you're.

159
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:19.830
Eriol Fox Reichelt: participatory insight is just you give it up to the moment that you write it down in these communities, and I think that that's kind of a very colonial.

160
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:31.020
Eriol Fox Reichelt: view an approach of this kind of engagement, I think that a lot of those participants enter into that space with the assumption, and with that kind of.

161
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:44.070
Eriol Fox Reichelt: With the expectation that they will whatever they give freely will be taken from but by these essentially kind of what Western European.

162
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:55.890
Eriol Fox Reichelt: folks making technology and that actually the true kind of nature and involvement of participatory design is often kind of assumed to be one that won't actually.

163
00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:58.680
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Be.

164
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:20.160
Eriol Fox Reichelt: truthful to its values, in a sense, you know participatory design is based to empower and supposed to be part of giving the users and participants of voice and and helping them understand what their part is to buy.

165
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:35.460
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Similar in that is deeply similar to open source software contributions and processes, but I do think that there is a very difficult reflection to be hard about like what.

166
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:45.240
Eriol Fox Reichelt: These processes both open source and participatory design mean in a cultural sense when you're doing it with the lens of like a humanitarian, human rights.

167
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:58.620
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Case essentially I don't know whether that necessarily is expressed when you have open source participatory design that it doesn't have a humanitarian or human rights purpose or.

168
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:15.660
Eriol Fox Reichelt: lens because i've not this isn't a reflection on a project that doesn't have that lens, so this is a reflection on project that is, from a humanitarian, human rights perspective, so I cannot reflect on open source that does not have that purpose.

169
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:18.180
Eriol Fox Reichelt: um.

170
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:23.880
Eriol Fox Reichelt: yeah I think I will stop here for now.

WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:12.150
Eriol Fox Reichelt: um so I wanted to make sure that I covered this reflection just in a second separate recording and I think that I focused a lot on the.

2
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.510
Eriol Fox Reichelt: I did talk a little bit about the different stakeholders in participatory design, but I didn't talk about the other people working on the open source and I think that this is a.

3
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:35.130
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Again, and really kind of complicated reflections try and communicate in with the lens of like participatory design, because I think when we talk about open source software.

4
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:51.330
Eriol Fox Reichelt: We have very often ill defined roles within an open source software so, even if I am a paid designer on this open source software project for organization a and there are several other.

5
00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:03.420
Eriol Fox Reichelt: staff members that are paid an amount of money to work on projects for organization a on the open source software it's not always very clear.

6
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:23.130
Eriol Fox Reichelt: What what amount of time they will spend on what kind of part of that open source software because it's often quite well reflection of this project was there is a quite a big open source software tool and ecosystem, essentially, so I think that.

7
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.180
Eriol Fox Reichelt: When I think about participatory design and I reflect upon it within open source software, I also think of the participatory design that you do not only with the users.

8
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:48.480
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Of that tool, like the end users, that are using the tool, but also the different roles that are involved with using that tool which also include the developers developing that tool so there's a lot of literature.

9
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:59.220
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Around about who are the multiple different people users personas that participate in open source software.

10
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:15.780
Eriol Fox Reichelt: And are the users of it and you could argue that the because they work on it and develop it and, like the developers or designers whoever works on the tool and contributes to em you could.

11
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.520
Eriol Fox Reichelt: describe them, not necessarily as participants to do participatory design processes with.

12
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.990
Eriol Fox Reichelt: or like activities, whether you could you could categorize them as like staff working on something.

13
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:42.630
Eriol Fox Reichelt: But actually then, what do you call the people that don't get paid to do that, and what do you call the people that get paid to do some work on the tool but also get don't get paid to do other work on other parts of the tool.

14
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.340
Eriol Fox Reichelt: And their roles within open source software become really difficult to.

15
00:02:50.190 --> 00:03:04.200
Eriol Fox Reichelt: draw lines between really, really quickly, and I think that the relationship that this has to participatory design is that who do we do participatory design with like, as the participants and the users of that.

16
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:16.110
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Is it going to be solely these end users that actually have no involvement in how it gets developed, but is that in contradiction to something I said earlier, which is where the.

17
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.200
Eriol Fox Reichelt: way of making participatory design a three process in open source is then.

18
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:36.000
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Helping the or finding a method to which the participatory design participants can then engage with the open source software contribution process and that it's like bringing it full circle in order to.

19
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:46.350
Eriol Fox Reichelt: kind of make sure the participatory design insights are fed into the open source software, but then does that then make them no longer the participant beneficiary.

20
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:58.380
Eriol Fox Reichelt: and user role does that then do they then become this this different role within open source which is sort of unpaid staff and contributor volunteer.

21
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.980
Eriol Fox Reichelt: And does that mean that, at that point they end their relationship with participatory design as a process.

22
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:13.710
Eriol Fox Reichelt: And what does that mean, so I think that I wanted to give that framing first because I how, on reflection, have done a lot of participatory design with.

23
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:33.630
Eriol Fox Reichelt: All different kinds of users and personas of open source software and I do think that one of the trickiest things here is how we could or do define participatory design and with whom and how that is expressed as participatory design.

24
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.900
Eriol Fox Reichelt: As a co design process.

25
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:52.290
Eriol Fox Reichelt: How far does that go because within the open source software space, it could go as far as than actually being like that person who developed that expression of.

26
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.530
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Whatever was kind of came out with a participatory design process and actually refines it actually makes them.

27
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:07.140
Eriol Fox Reichelt: And then, like at what point does a user end user beneficiary participant of participatory design then become a developer.

28
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:21.420
Eriol Fox Reichelt: And as a developer, a end user, and in what way, so I do think that one of the trickiest things and one of the most interesting things to really figure out within a participatory design in relationship with open source software is are these.

29
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.240
Eriol Fox Reichelt: roles that we have within open source software and how they feed into each other and and.

30
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:35.220
Eriol Fox Reichelt: Not necessarily defining the roles, or where they stop an end within participatory design, but understanding that participatory design.

31
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:58.020
Eriol Fox Reichelt: has an evolution process to go through for open source or has an adoption process to go through in open source software to be able to follow it through in that co design process way if it is indeed the goal to take participatory design through into relationship with open source software.
