# Personal Statement phd 2020

I’ve been a practicing visual communication designer for 10 years across many different functions and job titles in many industries. From Junior design to Ui designer to UX designer and then lead designer I’ve worked in the insurance, finance, compliance, technology and humanitarian sectors. The common theme throughout these jobs have all been the rise in designers participation in digital tools that are used by people locally, nationally and globally. 
The focus of design shifting from something that could describe ‘art’ or creative expression to more of a problem solving, inclusion, usability and relevance focus. I’ve dedicated my time and practice in learning and practicing dedicated inclusion and usability in my design work that extend beyond my narrow field of local reach and aimed to be inclusive of all people (or users) of all abilities and circumstances with the firmly held belief that in today’s connected and global society anyone with the access and means can use a digital tool and benefit from it and therefore, it is my responsibility to make that the best most inclusive tool I can.

While refining my design career, I have been involved in community and humanitarian projects. These projects (since around 2007) have involved activities and projects from funded environmental projects to clean up urban spaces to digital mapping projects to access to free educational support for newly immigrated individuals and they families and large scale LGBTQIA+ focussed events. The involvement in non-profit work benefitted from my technical competence and I always looked for ways in which I could combine my technical, digital and design skills for good across the projects I was involved in. As my career took a global humanitarian turn with working at Ushahidi I became further involved in the global and humanitarian aid approach to technology and inclusion of design, especially when the potential to introduce design methods and activities could benefit the humanitarian programming.

Most recently in Ushahidi I’ve worked on two large scale programs, Isooko which looks at how digital technologies can impact peace building in places like Rwanda and Kenya where tribal violence, genocide and democratic violence is prevalent. How does digital technology play into these events and how can empowering people with tools can they promote peace vs conflict. I employed various design methods alongside the staff at the University of Leiden, Kings College London and The University of Makerere. The project benefitted greatly from not only an academic approach to design methodologies and activities but also a practicing design in the humanitarian technology space.
The second program I led was in partnership (and funded by) Adobe and Designit (a global design agency) and looked at how designers could become more involved in humanitarian work through using their skills on humanitarian Open Source Software (OSS) projects. From the programmatic organisation to the research into methodological approaches to the implementation of the project I led all aspects of this funded program within Ushahidi as the lead design resource therein. Focussing on Ushahidi’s free, open source, natural disaster and crisis communication tool as a pilot OSS project to see what the barriers to including designers in the contribution to OSS were on a global scale. I deliver many informal talks at a wider array of conferences including FOSS4G, All Things Open, Mozfest, DesignUP and Open Up Summit. The workshop activities were delivered in Bangalore and Taipei and actively included those who experienced humanitarian crisis as part of the workshop experiments. In Bangalore we looked at the Kerala floods and in Taipei we looked at Typhoons.

I’m profoundly and deeply passionate about designers (of all functions) inclusion in Open Source and humanitarian technology as I believe design is the part of technological innovation that is most critical when building for inclusion, relevancy and solving the problem. Long gone are the early silicon valley days of moving fast and breaking things. In the Humanitarian tech world, moving fast and breaking things costs lives and adds to suffering of our most marginalised people and designers have an ability to mitigate or remove that suffering by participating in and offering their skills and knowledge to humanitarian projects.

This is why I’m dedicated to researching, analysing, discovering and ultimately participating in the solution to the problem of the design within humanitarian open source projects as a whole and will continue to drive forward the inclusion of design as a way to guard and protect our most vulnerable people.
