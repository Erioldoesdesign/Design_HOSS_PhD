**Observation of Hackathon proceedings and participant activity**
The first focus of this research project was to critically explore how human-centred design is currently practiced and understood by the people who create and maintain Humanitarian/Human Rights related Open Source Software (HOSS and HROSS) and people who use the H/HROSS. Additionally, research into how human-centred designers, engage with and contribute to H/HROSS and why was investigated.
Finally, the researcher paid attention to the use of, or involvement with, the software by ‘beneficiaries’ changed the technology through these human-centred design practices.

H/HROSS is here on referred to as ‘OSS’ and/or ’tool/s’.

The researcher captured and measured data from observations of the hackathon to compare and analyse differences and similarities across a number of metrics such as: Collaboration, Inclusion across roles or functions, successful task completion, participation of designers etc.

This observation study was to observe hackathons that fit as many of the following criteria as possible:

1. The hackathon work will be done on an OSS with a license or intended to create openly accessible information and/or code.
2. The hackathon has a design presence to it e.g. asked for design contribution, self-described designers have been involved or mentioned design as an aspect of technology creation
3. The hackathon encourages and facilitates participation from technologists that identify as part of the community that the OSS benefits e.g. Refugees involved in creating technology for refugee needs
4. The hackathon organisers agree for the hackathon to be observed and agree to the processes laid out in this ethics application.


**Observation of open HOSS and HROSS repositories and publicly accessible spaces**
The second focus of observational study was to observe how the primarily text-based humanitarian and human rights OSS tool repositories discuss and understanding design and communicate with designers. The researcher additionally paid attention to the role of ‘beneficiaries’ in these spaces.

Repositories that were openly accessible and public and were observed without notifying the communities. 
Communities that use communications platforms that were accessible through a registration or login function were be notified of the researchers intention and presented with this documentation.

The researcher captured and measured data from observations of the repositories by reading and logging relevant comments, discussions and visual information relating to design and designers.

This second observation study was to observe repository activity that fit as many of the following criteria as possible:
Comments and discussions in issues (Github & Gitlab) with both written and visual information on any given 'design intervention/contribution'.
Discussions and interactions between the designers and other stakeholders of the OSS (Humanitarian/Human Rights or that hosts the OSS, Developers, other Designers, Other contributors to OSS)
Discussions and interactions between designers and specialists or subject matter experts which could be the Humanitarian/Human Rights field workers or direct or indirect beneficiaries of the OSS that facilitates the Humanitarian/Human Rights work of the org that hosts the OSS).
Links between discussion, contribution, collaboration and 'releases' (Pull Requests etc.) in the OSS and the timeframes involved including how long the changes remain part of the OSS.


As a participant in a hackathon/event or a contributor to H/HROSS, your behaviour, conversations and discussions would have been observed by the researcher and included within the wider [PhD](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD).


Thank you for your agreement to be observed in this research.


### What will happen to my information?

Observations of the participants and organisations will be collected in the form of written information and image evidence of discussion activity (with usernames redacted) and will be located on a secure laptop owned by the researcher and a fully anonymised version will be hosted on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD) under an [open source creative commons license](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/LICENSE.md) for written research and GPL or Apache or MIT for any future software code written.

All collected information can be review prior to hosting on Github to ensure accuracy and anonymisation is satisfactory.

The information collected from observations will inform the wider research on the PhD project.

**Why is this data needed?**

The participants information will be used to inform the wider understanding of design’s (and designers) place within Humanitarian/Human Rights open source software and will inform ongoing research to be produced in a Thesis. 
No information will lead to any possible privacy breach or identification of participants.

This observational data is needed in order to ensure a diverse and inclusive account of how people within humanitarian and human rights organisations collaborate with design and designers on their HOSS. Without this first-hand data we're working on past examples and anecdotal data which has questionable validity.

**Who do I contact if I have questions about the project?**
