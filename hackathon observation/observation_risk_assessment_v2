This risk assessment document summarises potential risks that are not covered in the [data management plan](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/hackathon%20observation/observation_data_management_plan_v2.md).

---


## Social risks
*disclosures that could affect participants standing in the community, in their family, and their job.*

- Risk of participant in hackathons attendance and their comments or information being recorded by the researcher and an employer or family locating this information to make judgements on their work hours or other life responsibilities. Mitigated largely by anonymising data at all times.
*Low risk*

- Risk of the participants being shunned by the OSS community, peer groups or otherwise for having engaged in a socially sensitive topic related to the research. This research doesn't anticipate directly discussing sensitive issues but as their is a humanitarian and human rights aspect to this research there may be highly context specific issues to be careful of.
*Low risk*



## Legal risks
*activities that could result in the participant, researchers and / or University committing an offence; activities that might lead to a participant disclosing criminal activity to a researcher which would necessitate reporting to enforcement authorities; activities that could result in a civil claim for compensation.*

- Risk of plagiarised or 'copied' hackathon contributions (code, design or otherwise) as part of the hackathon being disclosed to the researcher. Hackathons and other software are OSS for the purposes of this research and therefore have more complications to content with lack of adhering to the licensing and dependancy licensing.
*Low Risk*

- Risk of mis-attribution or misuse of OSS via dependancies across licensing. If a framework or OSS technology is used and the subsequent OSS project is not in adherence to all the relevant dependancy tree licensing then their are risks to the OSS project being subject to any legal ramifications dictated by those licenses that were not adhered to.
*Low-Medium Risk*

- Risk of individual engaging in illegal activities or admittance of illegal activities while under observation or participating in this research. This research does not aim to look at the legal and illegal intricacies of humanitarian and human rights technology work and participation but acknowledges there may be disclosure of such activities. Those activities, if mentioned and if relevant to the research will be:
1. Reported to the correct and relevant authorities
2. Anonymised if/when used in public forum
*Low Risk*



## Economic harm
*financial harm to participant, researcher and / or University through disclosure or other event.*

- Risk of hackathon participants being solicited for money, donations or otherwise a contribution not stated clearly by the hackathon organisers or implied by the hackathon organisers e.g. 'An expectation and/or coercion to contribute free time post hackathon agreement' and /or make monetary donations/contributions to others or themselves which could be considered bribes under certain organisational policy. Money should only exchange between researcher/University and the participants where clearly defined and stipulated under compensation rules for the PhD program.
*Low Risk*

- Risk of damage to the researchers technology equipment and data as part of intentional or unintentional malware, hacking or data breach. Research has the appropriate virus and malware scanning software as well as a [Data Management plan](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/hackathon%20observation/observation_data_management_plan_v2.md) in accordance with University guidelines and stipulation.
*Low Risk*

- Risk of hackathons or observed projects and/or people having a connection to the researchers part-time paid NGO job where there could be conflict of interest or risk. Researchers work place is notified of all public projects and events that participate in this research and are able to advise where this risk is likely.
*Low Risk*


## Reputational risk
*damage to public perception of University or the University/researchers’ reputation in the eyes of funders, the research community and / or the general public.*

- Hackathon and/or projects and/or participants could produce tools/software that is intentionally or unintentionally harmful to those that use those tools in the Humanitarian/Human rights spaces. Examples of intentional harm include the risk of hackathon participants including malware as part of the open source software contribution they make and it not being found/recognised and unintentional being users inputting personal data into the open source software and that data not being properly securely stored leading to personal identifying information leaks.
*Low-Medium Risk*


## Safeguarding risks
*risk to young people, vulnerable adults and / or researcher from improper behaviour, abuse or exploitation. Risk to researcher of being in a comprising situation, in which there might be accusations of improper behaviour.*

- Risk of the researcher not having needed cultural context on a specific humanitarian, human rights or social issue that a participant identifies from and therefore a insensitive remark is made. Unlikely due to the researchers time spent working in humanitarian and human rights space and also mitigated by training via the university.
*Low Risk*

- Risk of hackathon organisers or those responsible not having in place a safeguarding policy or code of conduct and should a safeguarding problem arise there being no accountable source. To mitigate this risk the researcher will only observe and research events that have an organisation with a safeguarding policy.
*Low Risk*


## Health and safety risks
*risks of harm to health, physical injury or psychological harm to participants or the researcher. Further information on health and safety risks is given below.*

- Risk of prolonged time at screens/desks of both researcher and research participants. Researcher and participants will not be observed for longer than 90 mins without a break and encouraged to take regular breaks.
*Low Risk*

- Risk of participants in research experiencing vicarious trauma or re-experiencing their own trauma in relation to humanitarian and human rights topics. Mitigated by training from the University hosting the researcher and flagged by researcher to potential hackathon events organisers and projects.
*Low-Medium Risk*
