### [Innovation by design at UNICEF: An Ethnographic case study](https://www.academia.edu/16972372/Innovation_by_Design_at_UNICEF)

**Abstract**
An ethnographic case study of the Innovation Unit of UNICEF, the United Nations Children Fund, examines how design attitude approaches manifest within the innovation agendaof the organization. Our analysis illuminates key principles, practices and processes involved inthe programmatic implementation of the innovation mandate at UNICEF and reveals theemergent nature of modes of generative design responsible for new configurations of socialpractices. Thestudy confirms the positive impact of key design attitude dimensions in advancing processes oforganizational change and identifies a set of wins for design while also pointing to real barriersthat illustrate how these design modes remain at the edge of an uncharted territory. At the macro-level of analysis, two important findings of the study reside in elucidating how design attitude inthis organizational context of global innovation is impacted by the themes of accountability andurgency that govern the institutional logics of the organization.


### [The Usability of Open Source Software: analysis and prospects](https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/2052/The%20Usability%20of%20Open%20Source%20Software.pdf%3bsequence=1)

**Abstract**
Open source communities have successfully developed many pieces of software although most computer users only use
proprietary applications. The usability of open source software is often regarded as one reason for this limited distribution. In
this paper we review the existing evidence of the usability of open source software and discuss how the characteristics of opensource development influence usability. We describe how existing human-computer interaction techniques can be used to
leverage distributed networked communities, of developers and users, to address issues of usability.



### [Examining Usability Work and Culture in OSS](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-17837-0_6)

**Abstract**
Organizational culture has been recognized as an influential factor affecting the successes and failures of usability work in organizations; however, there is a lack of research on organizational culture in open source software (OSS) development. This paper shows that there are different kinds of cultures in OSS development projects and builds propositions on the relationship between culture and usability work in OSS development projects. Partly those are derived from the literature, partly from an exploratory empirical inquiry. We speculate whether there is an ideal culture type for usability work in OSS development or whether usability work should be modified to fit the different cultures of OSS development projects.

## What the observation study intends to achieve

The purpose of this research is to critically explore how human-centred design is currently practiced and understood between by the people who create and maintain Humanitarian/Human Rights related Open Source Software (HOSS) and users of the HOSS. In addition, how do human-centred designers themselves, engage with and contribute to HOSS and why.
The aim of this critical exploration is to better understand what practices support a collaborative, inclusive and human-centred design process for the HOSS and if the use of the HOSS and relationship to the HOSS, by the beneficiaries, is changed through these human-centred design practices. 

This specific observation study is to first observe 3 hackathons that fit the following criteria:

1. The hackathon work will be done on an OSS with a license.
2. The hackathon has a design presence to it e.g. has asked for design contribution or mentioned design in some clear way
3. The hackathon encourages and facilitates participation from technologists that identify as part of the community that the OSS benefits e.g. Refugees for refugee related technology
4. The hackathon organisers agree for the hackathon to be observed and agree to the processes laid out in this ethics application.

The second part of this study will be to participate in 1 hackathon that also covers the above criteria.

I will capture and measure the information and data from observations of the hackathon to compare and analyse differences and similarities across a number of metrics such as: Collaboration, successful issue/task completion, participation of designers etc.

Examples of these hackathons are:

The second piece of the observational study practice is to observe how the non-live, text-based humanitarian and human rights OSS tool repositories of 'issues' (tasks for OSS developers and other contributors) develop their discussions and understanding of design and designers along with what processes, methods and tools designers use to encourage collaboration along with any communications platforms outside of these repositories. Repositories are open and public and can be observed without notifying the communities, however many of these communities use communications platforms that are either open ([matrix](https://matrix.org/) or [IRC chats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat))

## Areas of observation

1. Comments and Discussions in issues (GitHub & Gitlab) with both written and visual information on any given 'design intervention/contribution'.
2. How the 'HOSS project' characterised by those that maintain and 'code' the project discuss and interact with designers contributing to the HOSS.
3. How the designers interact with specialists or subject matter experts which could be the Humanitarian/Human Rights field workers or direct or indirect beneficiaries of the HOSS that facilitates the Humanitarian/Human Rights work of the org that hosts the HOSS).
4. How the designers interact with other stakeholder of the HOSS (Humanitarian/Human Rights orh that hosts the HOSS, Developers, Other Designers, Beneficiaries, Subject Matter Experts/Field Workers, Other contributers to HOSS)
5. Closely monitoring the links between discussion, contribution, collaboration and 'releases' in the HOSS technology and the timeframes involved including how long the changes remain part of the HOSS.

## Data types to collect

1. Comments and Discussions in issues (GitHub & Gitlab).
2. Images or 'design' that has visual output connected to any comments and discussion threads.
3. What tools, methods, methodologies, processes and practices are used by designers with each other stakeholder of the HOSS (Humanitarian/Human Rights orh that hosts the HOSS, Developers, Other Designers, Beneficiaries, Subject Matter Experts/Field Workers, Other contributers to HOSS).
4. Coversation and discussion over video (or in person should hackathons resume in person activity post-covid resriction easing). Via video, audio, transcript etc.
5. Code, documentation and written contributions in Pull Requests (updates) to a given repository.
6. Relevant supplementary documents e.g. etherpads, google docs, miro board, post-its, published open written notes etc.

## Probing ethnographic contextual questions

1. How do the actors involved collaborate? With whom and at what frequency? What are the nature of their collaborations?
2. How do different kinds of collaborations, methods, interactions 'impact' or 'improve' the HOSS and for who  at what scale?
3. How is design understood throughout the contribution process and what do designers do in order to contribute? How do they themselves categorise their design contributions to HOSS?
4. How do these interactions, contributions and processes differ from the expected nature of the same subjects? How powerfully do expectations of differing stakeholders play into collboration in HOSS?
