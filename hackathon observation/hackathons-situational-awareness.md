# Hackathons situational awareness

Ahead of the Hackathon Observation data gathering I read a number of articles, blogs and content pieces from organisationa dn indviduals writing on hackathons. The nature of the hackthons is important, whether they were specifcally focussed on OSS, whether they were Humanitarian/Human Rights technology focused, a combination of OSS + Hum & HR focussed and also whether there were design processes or designers mentioned at all.
