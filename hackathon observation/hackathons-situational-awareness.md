Ahead of the Hackathon Observation data gathering I read a number of articles, blogs and content pieces from organisationa dn indviduals writing on hackathons. The nature of the hackthons is important, whether they were specifcally focussed on OSS, whether they were Humanitarian/Human Rights technology focused, a combination of OSS + Hum & HR focussed and also whether there were design processes or designers mentioned at all.


### [Techfugees Guiding Principles](https://www.notion.so/Techfugees-Guiding-Principles-b869ab9cd6754c78bcd6e5391f020e4a)
*This section of the Internal Wikipedia was created in 2021 by the Techfugees volunteer community is used to knowledge share how responsible digital tech innovations can empower inclusion of displaced persons.*

*8 Guiding Principles following years of orchestrating innovation hackathons and open-events across 25 countries with and for displaced persons.*
* [1. Working with (and not only for and about) displaced persons (#HumanCenteredDesign, #Co-creation)](https://www.notion.so/1-Working-with-and-not-only-for-and-about-displaced-persons-HumanCenteredDesign-Co-creation-b968b96e0a004633bcfbc8a97eafdaf0)
*Any design and deployment of technology shall use a human-centered design approach, which is a process that starts with refugees and ends with tailored made solutions that suit their needs.*

* [2. From tech user to tech empowered (#Empowerment)](https://www.notion.so/2-From-tech-user-to-tech-empowered-Empowerment-11392e4039c8492d8cef375417c01166)
*aim to make your targeted users not only beneficiaries of your technology, but aim to build it with them and make them co-creators.*

* [3. Don’t collect data for data’s sake (#DataGovernance #Dataprivacy #Transparency)](https://www.notion.so/3-Don-t-collect-data-for-data-s-sake-DataGovernance-Dataprivacy-Transparency-b60ac711771d4005b5b24a5090178cad)
*Displaced persons can be helped as well as harmed by the use of data.*

* [4. Sharing is caring (#Opensource)](https://www.notion.so/4-Sharing-is-caring-Opensource-e55de14465f5467bbc893b93e703dbdd)
*The open-source model is our favored model for software development when building tech for refugees. Open source projects are adequate with our philosophy of empowering vulnerable, displaced populations: open source code is of universal access, decentralized and co-created by nature.It encourages collaboration and so peer-to-peer learning within the community.*

* [5. Because we are all in this together (#InclusiveTech #Tech4all)](https://www.notion.so/5-Because-we-are-all-in-this-together-InclusiveTech-Tech4all-a213a162fd4d41b6abb60c953f73e6bc)
*What works at empowering displaced populations could be used to help other vulnerable populations, like homeless people or unemployed youth. Building technology for refugees should contribute to the development of the entire community*

* [6. Good intentions are great to start but sustainability is the key to real impact (#Sustainability)](https://www.notion.so/6-Good-intentions-are-great-to-start-but-sustainability-is-the-key-to-real-impact-Sustainability-c4326791c8c5488796fd2099979ba355)
*you are dealing with users that rarely have the luxury to have other options; as such you should ensure consistent service and be ready to take appropriate measure if the technology proves to be dysfunctional or outdated.*

* [7. Integration isn’t just about challenges of refugees, it is a (very) political battle too (#HumanRightsBasedApproach)](https://www.notion.so/7-Integration-isn-t-just-about-challenges-of-refugees-it-is-a-very-political-battle-too-HumanR-d40c8c8b91874d07a5666bcd695f3500)
*it becomes very political very fast and the issue tends to be that laws are constraining or preventing empowerment of the very people you are trying to help.*

* [8. Tech is just a tool (#NoSolutionism)](https://www.notion.so/8-Tech-is-just-a-tool-NoSolutionism-3ddcf4151b1b47dbbcca307672bfbcd6)
*Technology alone cannot make up for the absence of political will or the lack of a shared commitment to solving the challenge as a global community.*

### [Why We Hack for Freedom](https://innovation.mit.edu/blog-post/why-we-hack-for-freedom/)
The first part of this blog/article by Mirar Bristol speaks to weak ties being stronger transmittors of novel information than strong ties and how information travels across social spaces. The arguement here is that Hackathons are comproised of people with weak ties which has a concentrated time period to share essential information pertaining to the subject that hackathon is about and, as stated by Mirar Bristol, promotes creativity.
This specific hackathon they reference is in relation to technologies effect on human trafficking (specifically sex trafficking).
A common statement is made in this blog/article re. Hackathons which is 'we were able to bring together' which doesn't state how intentional the bringing together of specific people (strong ties?) or non-specific people of a particular interest/skill (weak ties?).
*"At its root a hackathon is about getting a group of like-minded people together to experiment, share, and maybe build something amazing through collaboration and knowledge sharing. It is an effort of passion and a craft."*
The closest reference to the act of designing is the term 'craft', though there are other terms here used which are more design research based such as 'collabortion', 'experimetation' etc. And OSS which is 'sharing'.


### [Fedora: A Case Study of Design in a FLOSS Community - Máirín Duffy](https://t.co/J9ddMFzcGr)
*For example, a designer may complete a  redesign of an existing UI, but in order to get that redesign  implemented, the designer must first find the correct code  maintainers, then work to gain their buy-in on the redesign  work."*
*The transparent and open processes by which  FLOSS design should occur according to Trudelle [35] may  also pose a cultural challenge to designers wishing to  contribute.* 
*The FLOSS community needs designers to teach proper  user-centric development processes and help reform the  currently-broken ones.*
**In the recommendations section**
*Hold real-time design 'hackfests'  Hackfest are a common type of event in FLOSS  communities. While much FLOSS development occurs on  non-real-time communication methods such as mailing  lists, blogs, and version control commit messages,  contributors regularly check in with each other in real-time  in order to discuss and make higher-level decisions. Many  times, this takes the form of in-person or online 'hackfests,'  which are simply a gathering of FLOSS contributors at a  pre-determined time with a pre-determined set of tasks or  problems to discuss and solve.   Fedora Design Team's recent 'hackfest' (an interaction-  design hackfest focused on Fedora stakeholder interviews  for the website redesign on 24 Nov 2009 [9]) culminated in some very positive results – the team gained two new  contributors and resulted in the completion of 3 full  stakeholder interviews and the assignment of 3 additional  ones to volunteers. Furthermore, it increased visibility of  the design team and its process across the project: the event  was announced on a project-wide blog, its results were  summarized on discussed on that same project-wide blog  [10], and curious Fedora contributors from other teams  within the project attended the event in order to observe and  learn more about design.   Schwartz and Gunn [32] report success in involving  designers in FLOSS projects using similar events called  'Usability Sprints.'* 

This paper by Máirín Duffy speaks to some of the ways in which OSS culture implicitly organises and how hackathons are a way of breaking down some of those processes that are not as familiar to designers as they are (typically) to developers.

### [‘Digital Future of Justice’: Insights from the hackathon](https://data.europa.eu/en/news-events/news/digital-future-justice-insights-hackathon) & [TJENI Hackathon: Pioneering Digital Solutions for Human Rights in Justice](https://www.coe.int/en/web/national-implementation/-/tjeni-hackathon-pioneering-digital-solutions-for-human-rights-in-justice) & [Digital Future of Justice](https://digitaljustice.tech/)
*The event revolved around the topics of digital transformation, human rights, and easier use of case law databases. The hackathon focused in particular on developing tools for automated indexing of judicial decisions with human rights categories.*
*The winning project was evaluated on the basis of criteria such as innovation, feasibility, applicability, tool performance, scalability and compliance with data security and privacy standards.*
*The competition not only encouraged technological ingenuity but also highlighted the pivotal role of multidisciplinary collaboration in developing solutions that uphold human rights within the justice system.*

Of the 29 people that comprised the teams described, it was not stated how many were of what kind of profession/practice - user experience is mentioned but not mentioned in relation to any project (winner or otherwise) and design/user experience methods are not given a chane to explain why/how they played an (important or otherwise) part in the hackathon.

Upon contacting the Hackathon organisers they sent over the hackathon events company ['wrap up'](https://www.kreativdistrikt.com/recap-of-the-digital-future-of-justice-hackathon/) which again did not contacin any references to design processes used in the hackathon. Furthermore the project titles show no related results on github or gitlab. There was also links to some [video recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e4buMXHt-E) of session that happened during the hackathon event


### [HACK FOR HUMANITY - Community Centered Design: Improving the Humanitarian User Experience](https://watson.brown.edu/chrhs/education/Hack-for-Humanity)
*brings together students to learn about the most pressing needs in the human rights and humanitarian sphere and develop creative ideas for innovative programs or technologies that could help improve the lives of disaster and conflict affected communities around the world.*
*This year's hackathon will focus on how to better prepare for and respond to humanitarian emergencies through community centered design. Students will work together over the course of two days to develop creative ideas for innovative programs, systems, or technologies that could improve the humanitarian user experience when responding to disasters or conflict. While your team has the flexibility to address any area that is applicable to the overarching topic of community centered design*

This is one of the first hackathons (humanitarian/human rights focused or not) that specifically calls out design as an integral part of the process of building technology. This hackathon specifically calls out community centred design. I believe this is because of other writing on the subject of humanitarian work needing to be an inclusive beneficiary/people centred process.

This hackathon also provided [a resource booklet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K1kvRuqlb_W_pqn12RIWZ4EOVzGwxYAl/view) which referenced design in the title and in a chapter titled 'Section 5: User Centered Design Sub-Topics' (with some [guidance on that subject here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SD4j_MZM9fv3zA9dAmKLBNKDrTdRfySO1TizO6kupEo/edit)). The activities were centred around stakeholder analysis but more so around the hackathon participants understanding the complex humanitarian ecosystems. Other sections include various canvases like business model canvas and design thinking templates.

Interestingly this hackathon published the [evaluation criteria](https://watson.brown.edu/chrhs/files/chrhs/imce/education/Hack%20for%20Humanity_Evaluation%20Framework.docx.pdf) for 'winners' which included both explict references to design and ways of practicing design in evaluation stages 2 and 3 as well as the last stage 7.


### [Human Rights Hackathon ‘EqualiTECH 2020’](https://crd.org/2020/11/24/apply-now-for-human-rights-hackaton-equalitech-2020/)
*Are you programmer, designer or IT professional with an interest in human rights? Do you and your team have what it takes to unlock the endless digital possibilities in fighting inequality and injustice in the Western Balkans?*
*participants will have a full weekend to think of and discuss innovative tools that will ease the work of human rights activists and marginalized society.*

This hackathon mentions design/designers as an integral part of the recruitment phase of the hackthon but [little is said after the event](https://crd.org/2021/04/23/safometer-and-needs-in-transit-equalitech-winning-products-out-now/) by the [civil rights defenders](https://crd.org/) or FLOSSK in how these projects were conducted. Both the projects websites seem to be down as of 2023 but a search on github shows [needsintransit](https://github.com/XhesikaLeka/needsintransit) and [safometer](https://github.com/EdonaHaziraj/Safometer). No issues eithe ropen or closed and no documentattion beyond the code needed to deploy/install those projects exists. [A facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/416245782743487/?active_tab=discussion&locale=ms_MY) exists for the event but no discussions have happened 'in the open' despite this being backed by a regional FLOSS (Free Libre Open SOurce Software) organisation.


### [Announcing the 6th Global Virtual Design Sprint](https://medium.com/dallas-design-sprints/announcing-the-6th-global-virtual-design-sprint-may-3-28-2021-ef7c4be902ef) and an now unpublished article from 2018 I have saved as a .pdf that I'll reference.
*the Global Virtual Design Sprint (GVDS), those advancements and explorations are showcased in a month-long event designed to teach others how to do them. With a ‘learn-by-doing’ model at its core, the GVDS brings an international team of practitioners and professionals together to showcase what they do best.*
*5 out of the 6 teams finished the week with a testable prototype.
Almost all teams were able to schedule qualified testers to verify their
designs/approach.*

The Global Virtual Design sprint is what I would describe as a hackathon-like event but focuses on on the design aspects of technology innovation - with the ideal to produc a testable prototype but not the pressure to produce functioning 'code' or 'software'. The official description is only available via [the way back machine as the url is no longer active](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127203038/https://www.virtualdesignsprint.com/gvds5-faq)
Different to the hackathons noted previously almost all the attendees were some kind of design professional and the processes in place were all 'design' activities. Presumeably aligned with how design sprints are taught in a particular [referenced masterclass](https://go.ajsmart.com/masterclass). One significant thing to note is that the GVDS's are pay to enter, so participants are charged a fee to participate in an event which is not the case for most hackathons where winning teams would instead win a prize.
