**Dear Participant,**

You are invited to agree to an ‘observation study’ as part of the research project described below.

**What is the research project about?**

**Observation of Hackathon proceedings and participant activity**
The first focus of this research project is to critically explore how human-centred design is currently practiced and understood by the people who create and maintain Humanitarian/Human Rights related Open Source Software (HOSS and HROSS) and people who use the H/HROSS. Additionally, research into how human-centred designers, engage with and contribute to H/HROSS and why will be investigated.
Finally, the researcher is paying attention to if the use of, or involvement with, the software by ‘beneficiaries’ is changed through these human-centred design practices.

H/HROSS is here on referred to as ‘OSS’ and/or ’tool/s’.

The researcher will capture and measure data from observations of the hackathon to compare and analyse differences and similarities across a number of metrics such as: Collaboration, Inclusion across roles or functions, successful task completion, participation of designers etc.


**Observation of open HOSS and HROSS repositories and publicly accessible spaces**
The second focus of observational study is to observe how the primarily text-based humanitarian and human rights OSS tool repositories discuss and understanding design and communicate with designers. The researcher is additionally paying attention to the role of ‘beneficiaries’ in these spaces.

Repositories that are openly accessible and public and will be observed without notifying the communities. 
Communities that use communications platforms that are accessible through a registration or login function will be notified of the researchers intention and presented with this documentation.

The researcher will capture and measure data from observations of the repositories by reading and logging relevant comments, discussions and visual information relating to design and designers.


**What is the benefit to the community that your project is trying to achieve?**

This project is trying to better achieve a clear understanding of the ways in which beneficiaries, design, designers and the OSS tools interact, collaborate and maintain their OSS. With a hope to offer insight and clarity on processes, structures, methods and activity that benefits both the people involved and the sustained success of the OSS technology.


**Why am I being invited to participate?**

You have been asked to participate due to your work or involvement in humanitarian or human rights and your involvement/contributions to Humanitarian/Human Rights Open Source Software. This is either through contributing to a OSS through an issue/task submission in Github or Gitlab (or similar), through involvement with a hackathon or event or having worked at an organisation or company that has supported OSS in some way e.g. sponsoring company volunteer hours offered to a OSS etc. in either a paid or unpaid capacity. 

In this research we want to observe and understand the collaborations, contributions and conversations of those that have been involved in contributing to humanitarian and human rights HOSS in a broad sense and no matter what the nature and size of your contribution or involvement. 

You'll also be aged 18+ and able to give legal, informed consent to participate.


**What will I be asked to do?**

This observational research doesn't require you to do anything specific other than reading this [Participant Information sheet](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/hackathon%20observation/hackathon-observation-participant-information-sheet.md) and agreeing to and/or signing the [Consent form](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/hackathon%20observation/observations_consent_form_v2.md). 

We also have an additional [Debrief sheet](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/hackathon%20observation/observations_debrief_sheet_v2.md) for those that want to follow the research. 

The observation study relies on you participating and contributing is as natural a way as you would. 

If you would like to participate in additional research activities related to this PhD Research you can [follow the open repository here](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD)


**How much time will the project take?**

The observation research does not require you to do anything extra to what you would typically do when participating in H/HROSS and/or a hackathon for H/HROSS, Humanitarian or Human Rights work. 


**Are there any risks associated with participating in this project?**

This observation research does not ask you to do any additional or new actions than you typically would in OSS.

The researcher recognises that within humanitarian or human-rights work there is some information that may need to be abstracted and redacted from the transcription and notes. Any confidential or sensitive information about any humanitarian/human-rights organisations that is noted as being sensitive or classified will not be noted in any documents that can be associated with any individual. 

Any information about individual beneficiaries or people that are recipients of humanitarian/human-rights support or aid not already anonymised will be anonymised.

Please consider you own personal, organisational or professional risk when engaging openly in OSS projects.


**Any extra vulnerable groups we need to consider?**

We may be talking with people who are actively at risk in relation to the work that they do in humanitarian and/or human rights.

**Can I withdraw from the project?**

At any point you can withdraw yourself from the observation research, without withdrawing from contribution to the H/HROSS or hackathon/event, by contacting the researcher (P.Reichelt2@newcastle.ac.uk) to omit and/or ignore all data and information both digital and non-digital and to be deleted/destroyed within 30 days if it has been collected. This relates to [Article 17 of GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/?cn-reloaded=1). 

This withdrawal does not require any supplementary information with the request for withdrawal.

Data collected prior to withdrawal will be removed from any analyses.


**What will happen to my information?**

Observations of the participants and organisations will be collected in the form of written information and image evidence of discussion activity (with usernames redacted) and will be located on a secure laptop owned by the researcher and a fully anonymised version will be hosted on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD) under an [open source creative commons license](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/LICENSE.md) for written research and GPL or Apache or MIT for any future software code written.

All collected information can be review prior to hosting on Github to ensure accuracy and anonymisation is satisfactory.

The information collected from observations will inform the wider research on the PhD project.

**Why is this data needed?**

The participants information will be used to inform the wider understanding of design’s (and designers) place within Humanitarian/Human Rights open source software and will inform ongoing research to be produced in a Thesis. 
No information will lead to any possible privacy breach or identification of participants.

This observational data is needed in order to ensure a diverse and inclusive account of how people within humanitarian and human rights organisations collaborate with design and designers on their HOSS. Without this first-hand data we're working on past examples and anecdotal data which has questionable validity.

**Who do I contact if I have questions about the project?**

Contact Eriol Fox, PhD researcher on this project at P.Reichelt2@newcastle.ac.uk if there are any queries related to the project. 

If you have any complaints about the researcher or this PhD please contact [research.integrity@ncl.ac.uk](research.integrity@ncl.ac.uk) 

**If I want to participate, what do I do?**

You will first need to fill out a [Consent Form](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD/blob/main/hackathon%20observation/observations_consent_form_v2.md).

Once that is complete and received by the researcher they can then include your discussion, information and contributions within this research. You may want to check any subsequent information is satisfactorily accurate and anonymised. There may be a follow up request for more information through the communication method that you are comfortable with which you can accept or decline.


Yours sincerely,
Eriol Fox
