## 1. Description of the data

### 1.1 Type of study 
_Up to three lines of text that summarise the type of study (or studies) for which the data are being collected._

This research will involve conducting semi-structured contextual interviews where written (digital) notes, audio transcription, video and audio recording will be collected. Written information will also be captured in a virtual whiteboard (Miro) by both the researcher and the interview participant. Future types of studies include: Diary studies where participants write their own data in a format comfortable for them, shadowing and observation by the researcher will be captured in written and audio/video formats. Fieldwork will include participatory information collected from participants along with public online contributions to open repositories along with auto-ethnographic processes by the researcher.


### 1.2 Assessment of existing data 
_An explanation of the existing data sources that will be used by the research project, with references. Or an analysis of the gaps identified between the currently available and required data for the research._

- Literature reviews written on an open repository hosted on GitHub under the [Creative Commons Legal Code Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/legalcode)
- Relevant quantative data and qualatative data from literature reviews may be referenced throughout the PhD.
- Data sources offered by participant organisations.
- Relevant contextual open data sets e.g. [Humanitarian Data Exchange's humanitarian data](https://data.humdata.org/)


### 1.3	Types of data
_Types of research data to be managed in the following terms: quantitative, qualitative; generated from surveys, interviews, observations etc. Include the use of any code or software if it aids the creation or processing of the data._

- Quantitative
- Qualitative
- Interviews
- Observations
- Auto-ethnographic
- [HDX data](https://data.humdata.org/dataset)
- [HXL Standard](https://hxlstandard.org/)
- Open Git Repositories from participants (TBC)


### 1.4	Format and scale of the data
_File formats, software used, number of records, databases, (in terms that are meaningful in your field of research). Do formats and software enable sharing and long-term validity of data? How large is the data going to be?_

- Markdown .md
- Text Documents .docx .pdf and .ott
- Spreadsheet data .sdc .csv
- Sublime text 2, 
- Libre office & iWork suite
- Adobe PDF
- Miro
- GitHub browser & GitHub desktop
- Pen and Paper

Size of the Data does not expect to exceed 30GB. Formats will be defaulted to 'open' formats where applicable.


## 2. Data collection / generation
_Focus on the good practice and standards for ensuring new data are of high quality and processing is well documented._

Unless requested by a participant I will be using zoom for online interview/people based data gathering with their recording and transcription processing which is high quality. For field notes I'll be using a handheld audio recorder, preferably a smart mobile device with a companion AI transcription app. All software will be bias towards open source or free libre open source software with a privacy and security considerationa nd decentralised where possible.
Devices will be locked, either digitally as well as physically if appropriate with two factor authentication where available.

Note taking will happen either digitally on a password protected platform and device until it is anonymised and transferred to an open GitHub respository.
Physical notes taking will be comprehensive and written up digitally within 24 hours of the data gathering act. Physical notebook pages will never contain personal information directly related to the notes and be keep in seperate notebooks with connecting reference codes.

The processing of data will be time stamped when ever collected either in written or audio format.

### 2.1	Methodologies for data collection / generation
_How the data will be collected/generated._ 

Via video and audio recording with written transcription.
Written notes will be kept in dedicated note books related to the PhD and absracted for safety and privacy as much as possible.

The three methodologies that I will be using include:
* For self-reflective work I will being referencing both Liberatory Design and intersectional Feminist principles and values in research.
* For external engagements with participants I will be combining Liberatory Design with Living Labs methodology. 

### 2.2	Data quality and standards
_How consistency and quality of data collection / generation will be controlled and documented, through processes of calibration, repeat samples or measurements, standardised data capture or recording, data entry validation, peer review of data or representation with controlled vocabularies._

Data will double checked both buy the researcher and using supporting software to run through and check for any unusual results. The papers/summaries of data and the judgements around teh research topic informed by the data will be reviewed and checked by peers and supervisors where critical. Statistically significant sample sizes for qualatative research will be ensured and any quantative data will be repeated and captured using standardisation data capture or recording where appropriate.


## 3. Data management, documentation and curation


### 3.1	Managing, storing and curating data. 
_Briefly describe how data will be stored, backed-up, managed and curated in the short to medium term (https://www.ncl.ac.uk/library/academics-and-researchers/research/rdm/working/)_

Data will be captured on the devices, software and non-digital means described in above questions. The Data will be anonimised and de-identified in order to proptect vulnerable participants. Data that is digital will be stored on password portected devices and if there are online, closed repositories used they will be protected by username and passwords and two factor authentication where available. Decentralised platforms and open source platforms will be given preference.

Back-ups of data will be stored on a dedicated external harddrive with password protection and two factor authentication. University cloud back-up storage will be used to keep digital, cloud based backups. These are protected by institutional login and passwords.


### 3.2	Metadata standards and data documentation
_What metadata is produced about the data generated from the research? For example descriptions of data that enable research data to be used by others outside of your own team. This may include documenting the methods used to generate the data, analytical and procedural information, capturing instrument metadata alongside data, documenting provenance of data and their coding, detailed descriptions for variables, records, etc (see: www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards  / http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/document)_

Device metadata along with methods or software/tools used to generate data will be captured alongside individual instances of the data that is captured.


## 4. Data security and confidentiality of potentially disclosive information
_This section should be completed if your research data includes personal data relating to human participants in research. For other research, the safeguarding and security of data should also be considered. Information provided will be in line with your ethical review. Please note this section concerns protecting the data._

As stated previously data will be anonimised and de-identified prior to being present on any open source platforms alongside participant consented information.

All signed consent and participant documents will be never be shared outside of relevant university departments and via official university communications.

### 4.1	Main risks to data security
_All personal data has an element of risk. Summarise the main risks to the confidentiality and security of information related to human participants, the level of risk and how these risks will be managed. Cover the main processes or facilities for storage and processing of personal data, data access, with controls put in place and any auditing of user compliance with consent and security conditions. (https://www.ncl.ac.uk/research/researchgovernance/ethics/gdpr/)_ 

All GDPR processes and procedures will be followed.
Due to the nature of the reserach there may be a risk of participant information being searched for by 'bad actors' with intent to dox, troll or harass individuals given the nature of humanitarian and human rights work in the digital sector. the researcher has undertaken training by PEN America to prevent these kinds of attacks and as stated will be anonymising and de-identifiying participant data prior to publishing to any open or accessible platform.
Beyond these measure the researcher will practice good personal device sercurity such as never leaving devices logged in unattended etc.


## 5. Data sharing and access
_Identify any data repository(-ies) that are, or will be, entrusted with archiving, curating and/or sharing data from your study, where they exist for particular disciplinary domains or data types. [Information on repositories is available here](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/library/academics-and-researchers/research/rdm/sharing/)._ 

https://data.ncl.ac.uk/
https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Design_HOSS_PhD
https://data.humdata.org/


### 5.1	Suitability for sharing
_Is the data you propose to collect (or existing data you propose to use) in the study suitable for sharing?  If yes, briefly state why it is suitable.
If No, indicate why the data will not be suitable for sharing and then go to 5.3._

Yes, some of the data gathered by the researcher could be useful for future studies of a similar nature and the data that is stored on open repositories will be anonimised and de-identified to protect the participants informationa dn identity.

Consent documents and signed participant documents will never be stored on open accessible platforms and always be stored in a password protected device or storage and only released to university officials where relevant for due dilligence procedures and legal needs.

### 5.2	Discovery by potential users of the research data
_Indicate how potential new users (outside of your organisation) can find out about your data and identify whether it could be suitable for their research purposes, e.g. through archiving into a research data repository. Will the repository create a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI) to be included in research outputs, including publications?_

The open data hosted on the researchers open GitHub repository is findable via GitHub;'s search function.
The open data hosted on Newcastle Universitie's data servers will only be searchable but permitted users.
The data that has been submitted to be stored on HDX (https://data.humdata.org) is open and searchable by users of HDX.

### 5.3	Data preservation strategy and standards
_How long will the data be archived and shared for? Will any data be preserved but not shared? If yes, what is the plan for this long-term archiving?_

The open data will remain in the open source GitHub repository and at 10 years be reviewed for relevancy and accuracy and updated as such.
Any physical documents will be stored in long term university archives for 10 years post thesis at such it may be destroyed.
Physical note taking documents will be stored for 5 years on private property, preseved but not shared in their physical form. Photo's of notebook pages will be keep on a digital GitHub repository for 10 years.
Data that is submitted to be stored on HDX (https://data.humdata.org/faqs/licenses) will adhere to their own licensing.

### 5.4	Restrictions or delays to sharing, with planned actions to limit such restrictions 
_Restriction to data sharing may be due to participant confidentiality, consent agreements or IPR. Strategies to limit restrictions may include data being anonymised or aggregated; gaining participant consent for data sharing; gaining copyright permissions. For prospective studies, consent procedures should include provision for data sharing to maximise the value of the data for wider research use, while providing adequate safeguards for participants. As part of the consent process, proposed procedures for data sharing should be set out clearly and current and potential future risks associated with this explained to research participants._

If a participant excersises their rights to be forgotten and removed via GDPR I will process this request within 1 month. This information is contained within the consent form. The participant can also request removal of certain details but have the main information still present on the open source GitHub repository. 

Data sharing will be by attribution to the project and non commercial in nature as per the open source license: Creative Commons Legal Code Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0

## 6.	Responsibilities and Resources
_Are there any resources (e.g. storage/ training) that you will require to fulfil the plan?_

* Basic GDPR training
* Basic anonymisation and de-identification training
